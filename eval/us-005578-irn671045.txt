Dr. Walter Schüler, a German Jewish lawyer, was born on August 11, 1899 in Lokstedt (Kreis Pinneberg). In the late 1930's he worked for the law office of Dr. Siegfried Urias at the address Jungfernstieg 24. Like all lawyers of Jewish descent, Dr. Schüler lost his law credentials in November 1938. His application for permission to work as a so-called legal adviser ("Rechtskonsulent") at first was rejected; only Dr. Urias was allowed to practice as a legal adviser. Dr. Urias was able to emigrate to Chile in April 1939 and Dr. Schüler received permission to take over the law office. Dr. Schüler was instrumental in helping Dr. Urias procure the necessary paper work for emigration and he and Dr. Urias stayed in contact after Dr. Urias had left abroad. Besides Hamburg and Bremen, Dr. Schüler was responsible for representing Jewish clients in Stade, Verden, Oldenburg, Aurich and Thedinghausen. Dr. Schüler's last known address was Siemersplatz 4 in Hamburg-Lokstedt. In October 1943 he was deported to Auschwitz. He perished on April 29, 1945, in the last days of the war, in the Ebensee concentration camp.
