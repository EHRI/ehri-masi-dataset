Edith Newton (née Kramm) collection

1 folder, 75 photos

This collection was discovered by the manager of a housing scheme for the elderly where the subject had spent her last years and had died apparently without heirs some years before the collection was deposited at the library.

Little information could be gleaned from the collection itself save for the fact that Edith Kramm had been a Jewish refugee from Vienna and that she had a relationship with another former refugee, Paul Newton (formerly) Gröschel, whom she later married. A photograph of a memorial stone in the collection lists a number of individuals who were apparently deported to their deaths during the Holocaust. Included in this list are the names Bertha and Simon Kramm- possibly Edith's parents?<p>Contact was made with some of the correspondents of recent letters in the collection in an attempt to reconstruct Edith's biography. This was partly successful in so far as a connection was made between the Huppert family and Edith. Edith Kramm was a cousin of Herbert, Ernestine and Lily Huppert, Austrian Jews from Prague. Indeed on the same photograph mentioned above the name Alois Huppert is included.</p><p>For further biographical information see series 1924/4 which contains correspondence about Edith Newton.</p>

This collection comprises mostly correspondence between Edith Newton née Kramm, a Jewish refugee from Austria, and Paul Newton, formerly Neugröschel, also a Jewish refugee probably from Austria. In addition there is some general correspondence including official correspondence related to Naturalisation and a collection of photographs.
