Veronika Bajza was born April 1, 1941 in Budapest and was the only child of Dr. Jenö Bajza who held a doctorate in Economics, and Irma Basch Bajza, who owned a textile business. During the war, Jenö was in a labor camp. One day before the liberation, he was shot and killed when we went outside to get some food. Irma survived the war in hiding in basements and on false papers. Veronika was placed with Mr. and Mrs. Lajos Kenyeres. The families were good friends, and Jenö and Lajos worked together before the war. The Kenyereses hid and fed approximately 100 people during the war. After liberation, Veronika was temporarily placed with a family in Budapest, who temporarily changed her name to Veronika Tobias. She was eventually reunited with her mother.
