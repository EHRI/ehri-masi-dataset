Erzsébeth Steiner (nicknamed Bözsi, 1910-1945) was born in 1910 to Margit (née Katona, nicknamed Anyi, 1886-1944) and Simon Steiner (nicknamed Api, 1869-1944). She had one sister, Ágnes (later Ágnes Steiner Takács, 1906-1992) and the family grew up in Pécs, Hungary. She married Tibor Tarjan in 1931 and they moved to Budapest. Tibor Tarjan (1904-1945?) was born in 1904 in Szekszárd, Hungary to Mor Friedman (later Mor Tarjan, 1860-1920) and Fáni Löbl (ca. 1867-1910). He had three siblings, Aranka (1888-1944), Kornel (1893-1978), and Erzsébet (1898-1986). Tibor worked as a manager of the office of a leather factory and Erzsébet was a music teacher. Their son, Peter, was born in 1936. Prior to the German occupation of Hungary, Tibor was periodically sent to work camps as a forced-laborer. After the German occupation of Budapest in March 1944, he kept in sporadic contact with his family. He was deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp at some point but his fate is presently unknown. Erzsébeth’s parents were both deported from Pécs in July 1944 to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp where they were murdered. Erzsébeth and Peter moved into a Swiss protected building in November 1944. Erzsébeth was deported in December 1944, likely on a death march toward the Austrian border where she perished. Peter’s mother’s friend Panni Kertesz assisted in his survival as a hidden child in a safe building aided by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg. After liberation, Peter moved to Bonyhád, Hungary to live with his mother’s sister Ágnes, who survived in Auschwitz. He studied electrical engineering and immigrated to the United States in January 1957 following the 1956 Uprising. He received his Ph.D. from Syracuse University and settled in Miami, Florida.

The collection primarily consists of wartime letters written to Erzsébeth Steiner and her sister Ágnes in Budapest from their parents Margit and Simon Steiner in Pécs, Hungary prior to their deportation in July 1944 to the Auschwitz concentration camp. There are a few copies of correspondence of Erzsébeth’s husband Tibor Tarjan. Also included are transcriptions and translations of the letters by Erzsébeth and Tibor’s son Peter, and a personal narrative by Peter regarding his family’s Holocaust experiences.
