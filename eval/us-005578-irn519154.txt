Consists of one typed testimony, four pages, entitled "Andzia," written by Hania Stromberg in 2007. In the testimony, Mrs. Stromberg relates the story of Andzia (last name unknown), who was the Roman Catholic nanny for the Rom family, of Warsaw, Poland. By World War II, the children were grown, and all but the youngest, Tadek and Dorota, were safe in the United States. Tadek and his family perished in the Holocaust. Dorota spent much of the war in the Warsaw ghetto and Andzia sneaked food to her, nursed her when she became ill, and ultimately helped her escape the ghetto before it was liquidated. Dorota Rom was the donor's mother.
