Nazi propaganda film about people with disabilities: closeups

Reel 1 of 8: Line of people with disabilities, with nuns (nurses?) walking up to and past camera. Archway, grass. Dressed in ordinary clothes and aprons; dignified. Some in wheelchairs. One with large head. CU of man with large frontal lobe. 00:01:57 Man runs up to camera, limbs askew. Make him smile, toothless. Blows on little tin horn. CU, turns this way and that. 00:02:46 Happy woman, clapping and laughing. 00:03:08 Young woman in leather armchair outside. Maybe paranoid schizophrenic. Gesturing, dramatic faces. Clearly dealing with fantasy fears. 00:03:49 Doctor with woman, puts her into statue positions. She doesn't move (has long braid). 00:04:20 CU, nurse with young man, moving head. Another, female in wheelchair, hands deformed. Pan down to deformed legs and feet.
