210 files.

This fonds mainly contains correspondence, newspaper clippings, reports and notes. We find five series: the outgoing letters and cables sent to individuals and organisations (1918-1947), the letters and cables received from organisations and activists (1918-1938), general correspondence with various organisations (1935-1947), various documents such as lists of refugees, and a last series consisting of emigration applications (1938-1939). The Far Eastern Jewish Central Information Bureau corresponded notably with HICEM Brussels and the Service of Transmigration of the CARJ in Brussels in 1939 and 1940. This correspondence can be found in the file DAL/164 (totalling 808 pages).
