The sanatorium was founded by Dr. George Karamanis in 1907 and operated until 1966. It is considered both the first Greek mountain sanatorium and one of the best organized in Europe. In the 1990s, the sanatorium was transferred to a new owner who did not reopen. Today the building complex is in ruins.
