Antisemitic Biersteins: papers re identification

1 folder

The correspondence and papers in this collection were generated by staff at the Wiener Library in an effort to identify the provenance and significance of two beer tankards which were deposited at the Wiener Library in memory of Leslie Simon Scott, formerly Ludwig Simon Schutz, of Berlin. The tankards were manufactured by the firm of Kerzilius of Cologne/ Ehrfeld.

The papers include descriptions of the tankards from experts at museums in Frankfurt and Munich; photographs of the tankards; correspondence between Wiener Library staff and various institutions re the tankards.
