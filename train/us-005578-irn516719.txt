In October 1944, Josef Szwarc (b. November 17, 1921 in Lodz, Poland), his two brothers, Pinchas and Leib, and their father, Jakub Szwarc, were deported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. They survived World War II. Josef's mother, Chaja Fajga, survived as well, but Ester Ita, a sister, who was born in 1919, was killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau in August 1944.

The collection consists of 48 photographs from Łodź, Poland, before World War II and of the Łodź ghetto. The collection illustrates the Szwarc family before the war and during their imprisonment in the Łodź ghetto.
