Sobibor Interviews 1983-1984, interview 09, Meier Ziss

Interview with Meier Ziss (Lublin 15 November 1927). Ziss arrived in Sobibor in June 1942. At first he worked as a barber, later he became 'Brandmeister' and had to burn the documents left behind by the people who had just arrived on a transport. In the camp he heard that his parents had been killed and he 'wanted to be dead together with them'. When he joined the partisans after the uprising he felt free and happy again. "There I was a human being." Meier Ziss grew up in Hrubiszow. After the war he went via Italy to Venezuela where he lived from 1956 to 1961. After that he went to Israel where he worked as an electronics dealer. It is unknown whether Meier Ziss is alive today.
