Le chant de la libération | Le Temps Des Cerises

Le chant de la libération (Le chant des partisans), created in London in 1942 by exiled Russian-French songwriter Anna Marly (1917-2006), became the anthem of the French Resistance during World War II. Originally in Russian, the lyrics were translated to French by the Russian-Jewish writer and resistance fighter Joseph Kessel (1898-1979) and his nephew, the writer Maurice Druon (1918-2009). Le Temps des cerises, a French popular song from the mid-19th century has had a long association with Revolutionary movements, beginning with the Paris Commune of 1871 and continuing to the present day.
