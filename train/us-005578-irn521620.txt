Rivka Radzinski was the daughter of Miriam Twersky and Dawid Radzinski of Warsaw, Poland. Her father, an activist in the Zionist labor movement and a founder of the Keren Kayemet (Jewish National Fund), refused to leave Warsaw when World War II began. Rivka, who was attending a teacher's college in Palestine, was in Poland for the summer and was unable to leave. Her younger brother, Josef, was deported to Treblinka in 1942. During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943, Rivka and her parents found a bunker beneath 5 Karmelicka Street where they are thought to have perished. Rivka's photograph album was left in Palestine and kept by a friend until 1996 when it was given to one of her surviving cousins.

Consists of approximately 186 pre-war photographs taken from the photograph album of Rivka Radzinski of Warsaw, Poland. Rivka, her father Dawid, a Zionist activist, and her mother, Miriam Twersky, were killed in the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
