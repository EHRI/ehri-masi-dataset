Soviet soldiers captured in Finland

Dead bodies (Soviets) in the snow. Bundled up Soviet prisoners/soldiers coming out of forest. The narration states that the Soviets have given up their resistance. Close ups of Soviets' faces, including a man with Asian features, who is eating something. One of the men's face is blackened, perhaps by frostbite?
