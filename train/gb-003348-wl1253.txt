Gerda Nabe: School project

1 folder

Nothing is known about the author. It is assumed that she must have been a pupil at a technical school in Celle, Lower Saxony- the folder in which the project was originally housed is entitled Berufschule Celle. It was clearly created as part of her coursework, as evidenced by the mark 'I/II' awarded by her teacher at the end, and the occasional comments within. With regard to the provenance of the document, it was discovered by the depositor's father who was stationed in Germany in 1946 with the British army. He found it amongst a pile of papers in his office (in Celle?) and managed to save it from being burned.<br /><br />The language is German and the script is predominantly SÃ¼tterlin.

This original school project documents a year of Hitler's rule in a series of compositions illustrated by photographs from newspapers and drawings. Produced by Gerda Nabe in 1935, it demonstrates the extent to which devotion to the nazi party and to its leader permeated German society, even to the level of school children. The project begins by reporting the elections in Saarland, when the residents chose to revert back to Germany again and provides a history of the region and its people. It goes on to commemorate the deaths of fallen nazi 'heroes'. It then marks the date that Hitler became Chancellor, going on to list his 'achievements' to 1935, including withdrawal from the League of nations, introduction of new army regulations and build up of the airforce. The remaining work is a chronological listing of dates significant to the nazi calendar, illustrated by descriptions of the most important such as the 'shameful' treaty of Versailles; the infamous Nuremberg rally, the founding of the nazi party etc. Noteworthy is the illustration of the Nuremberg Laws in the form of a family diagram depicting the levels of purity and 'mixedness', for which she received the top mark.
