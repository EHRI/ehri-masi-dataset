Radio Luxembourg - October 23, 1944

TRACK 1 Actual recording of a meeting of the Camp commitee, Democracy at work in miniature. Date Oct 23, 1944. Flüchtlingslager near Aachen. Q&A, mostly 2 voices. Laying the groundwork for true democracy, etc. (4:00) Improvised Camp chorus with accordion. Date Oct 23, 1944. Accordion intro. Male voice: "We are young people from Aachen evacuated to a camp near Aachen. We will present a short musical program." Selection of sentimental/patriotic folksong followed (at 6:30) by anti-Hitler lyric volunteered by young voice and encouraged by group leader, "You're free now to sing what you will!" Ensemble follows with Nazi-era hit song "Es geht alles vorüber" with added parody text: "Es geht alles vorüber, geht alles vorbei/Auch Adolf Hitler und seine Partei!" (updating a familiar wartime parody, "zuerst Adolf Hitler, dann seine Partei"). Rousing accordion solo yields to another sentimental choral song. End. TRACK 2 Date Oct 23, 1944
