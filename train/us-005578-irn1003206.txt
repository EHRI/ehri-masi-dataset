New Cabinet Meeting in Berlin

Title in German identifies the new cabinet. Sitting from left: [Hermann] Goering, [Adolf] Hitler, [Franz] von Papen; Standing from left: [Franz] Seldte, Gerecke, [Lutz] von Schwerin Krosigk, Dr. [Wilhelm] Frick, [Werner] von Blomberg, and Dr. [Alfred] Hugenberg. Scene opens inside the Hotel Kasierhof, before the cabinet meeting begins. Everyone wears suits, they mingle and talk to each other. Hitler, Goering, and Frick speak briefly. Hitler escorts von Papen to sit in the chair beside him, while Hugenberg stands behind von Papen's chair. Flashbulbs go off as people off-camera take photographs. Seldte and Goering speak briefly. Dialogue is audible but not intelligible. Scene switches to the torchlight parade passing the Chancellory, singing "Deutchland Ueber Alles." Von Hindenburg appears at the window.
