The poster was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

One-sheet poster for the film, “Gentleman’s Agreement,” premiered by 20th Century Fox on November 11, 1947. The film was based on a story written by Laura Z. Hobson, which was serialized from 1946-1947 and published in a stand-alone novel in 1947. “Gentleman’s Agreement” was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and beat RKO’s similarly themed film, “Crossfire” to win Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Director. The film also won four Golden Globes and was added to the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress in 2017. “Gentleman’s Agreement” tells the story of a journalist who pretends to be Jewish so he can write an in-depth story about antisemitism. He immediately begins to see the rooted antisemitism on all sides, from colleagues at his office, to interactions with a physician, and even at a hotel. As the ruse continues, a rift grows between the journalist and his fiancée, who is reluctant to speak out against antisemitic comments in her social circle. Prior to production, some Jewish executives in Hollywood feared that the film would actually incite more antisemitism. The film proved to be daring for its time, calling out openly antisemitic politicians and other public figures. It also forced the audience to come to terms with their own underlying views and actions, both overt and subtle. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
