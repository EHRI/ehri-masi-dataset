This collection of short biographies of Holocaust victims and survivors was created by staff at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum from interviews of survivors who described not only their own experiences but those of friends and family. The text was used to create identification cards for use in classrooms. The majority of the 37 biographies in this collection pertain to children.
