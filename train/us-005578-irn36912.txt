Chana Szulc Stein was born in 1911 in Ozorkow, Poland. She was incarcerated in the Lodz ghetto, spent a brief amount of time in Auschwitz, and was liberated in Bergen Belsen. Chana remained in the Bergen Belsen displaced persons camp until coming to the United States with her husband, Icek Stein, and daughter Marsha in April 1951.

Includes 67 photographs of life in the Bergen Belsen displaced persons camp. Photographs include the birth of Marsha Stein Sirman in a hospital, Glyn-Hughes, in Bergen Belsen. The images depict Marsha by herself, Marsha with her parents, Chana Szulc Stein and Icek Stein, and a German doctor, Dr. Ã–tker, who helped with Chana's delivery. Other photographs include the wedding of Sala Katzberg Rotrand and Moniek Rotrand. Sala Katzberg Rotrand was the niece of Chana Szulc Stein. There is also a post-war photograph of Moniek Rotrand in a hospital bed in Bergen Belsen with Sala Rotrand, Icek Stein, and other unknown individuals seated and standing at his bedside. Photographs also include older women in a hospital who gave birth in the Bergen Belsen displaced persons camp, daily life in Bergen Belsen, individual photographs of Chana Szulc Stein and Icek Stein, a Rosh Hoshana card of a couple in Bergen Belsen, and a woman wearing a wedding dress. The caption on the back of this photograph appears to read, "Maryla." Other photographs are of unknown individuals. There is another photograph of Chana Szulc Stein standing alone and one of Chana, Icek, and an unknown man looking outside the window of a building.
