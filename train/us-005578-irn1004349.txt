Propaganda film about the Reich Party Day 1936 and 1937

Three short clips from the propaganda film Festliches Nuernberg, filmed at the Reich Party Days in 1936 and 1937. 01:00:00 to 01:00:05 Exuberant crowds cheer and give the Nazi salute, presumably to a passing motorcade (5 seconds). 01:00:09 to 01:00:17 SS men carrying "Deutschland Erwache" standards march down an aisle in a hall, surrounded by saluting Nazis in uniform. A legend on the wall of the room says, "A strong government is the bulwark of peace." 01:00:20 to 01:00:32 Shots representing Germany's booming industry and economy: the launch of a huge ship, smokestacks with smoke rising from them, workers in factories, all accompanied by fast-paced music.
