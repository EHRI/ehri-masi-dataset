Letter, with envelope written by Sgt. Daniel Jacobson, of Baltimore, Maryland, while serving with the US Army's 179th Infantry, 45th Division in Munich, Germany, to his wife Julia Jacobson, 6 May 1945. The letter written on Hitler's personal stationery, describes the irony of being Jewish and using Hitler's stationery, and how he acquired it during a visit with other American soldiers to the ruins of Hitler's home in Berchtesgaden. He also describes a porcelain figurine that he took as a souvenir, and other impressions of Munich, where he was stationed at the time. Also included are three photographs of Jacobson and other American soldiers, and a news clipping featuring him and another soldier, both of whom knew each other when they lived in Muskogee, Oklahoma.
