Report from Drancy concentration camp

folder

1

Three typewritten pages documenting the first stages of the Holocaust of the Jews of France and the state of affairs within the Drancy concentration camp a few months after it was established in August 1941. The letter begins with a general description of the situation outside of the camp (arrests, attempts for family members to visit) and then includes a detailed description of living conditions in the camp (sleeping on floors, food rations, punishments). The bulk of the letter is dedicated to describing protests of Jewish physicians at the camp and the order to release prisoners whose conditions were especially bad.
