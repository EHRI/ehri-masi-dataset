13 files

The members of Rabbi Munk's family transferred the documentation regarding the welfare activities in which the Rabbi had been involved to the Institute for Research of the Jews of the Diaspora at Bar-Ilan University. From there it was submitted to the Yad Vashem Archives and kept in a separate Record Group.

The Record Group includes correspondence with relief and welfare organizations in Britain and Germany during the Nazi period and after the war, reports regarding the activities of these organizations and reports from visits of Jewish leaders in Germany after the war, including much information concerning the situation of the Jews living in various places in the country.
