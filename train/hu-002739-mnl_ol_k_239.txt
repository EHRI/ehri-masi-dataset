The Ministry of Industry (Iparügyi Minisztérium) was established in 1935 and partially replaced the Ministry of Trade (Kereskedelemügyi Minisztérium) that had just been abolished. The Ministry of Industry was in operation between August 1, 1935 and April 4, 1945. During the last months of the Second World War and Arrow Cross rule, it no longer functioned on a regular basis. Unfortunately, the actual materials of the Ministry of Industry were destroyed during the battle for Budapest in the winter of 1944-1945. The collection therefore contains papers that were preserved at other ministries of the time and relate to the activities of the Ministry of Industry. The information that can thus be attained is more of a sporadic than systematic nature on the activities of this ministry. However, there are several parts which are of interest for the historical study of the Holocaust in Hungary. For instance, next to questions of personnel and credit which were both increasingly intertwined with the “Jewish question” at this time, there are reports of Hungarian companies on their supplies in store and data on the removal of Hungarian companied to Germany from January to March 1944.
