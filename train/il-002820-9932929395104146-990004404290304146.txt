[Deutschfeindliche Propaganda in Griechenland]

1 electronic resource (3 pages)

The file contains a report of the German Embassy of Greece to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin dated 01.06.1933, signed by German Ambassador [Ernst] Eisenlohr, regarding anti â€“German agitation and propaganda in Greece. So far there is no systematic anti-German propaganda in Greece, neither in film, literature and theater, neither in the press, because the Greek government wants to uphold good relationships with every country. This is especially true for Germany, because of good trade relations, cultural relations and warm feeling towards Germany among large parts of the Greeks. For French anti-German propaganda, there would be a suitable French Daily Paper, "Messager D'Athenes". Singular attacks by newspapers like "Eleutheron Vima", "Eleutheros Anthropos", "Progres" and "Independence" do not have systematic character and could be defended by the embassy. Should there be larger scale attacks in the future, the embassy will ask for the support of the Greek Government and use the local German Newspaper "Griechische Post" for defense and counter-propaganda.
