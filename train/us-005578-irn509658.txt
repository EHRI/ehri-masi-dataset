Ernö Frankel was born on June 16, 1909, in Hungary. He immigrated to Paris, France, in 1931 because, as a Jew, he was unable to find a teaching job in Hungary. He left France in February 1943 to return to Budapest, Hungary, with his wife, Elisabeth, his son, George (b. August 8, 1941), and sixty other Hungarians. He served in the Hungarian Labor Battalion while he was living in Hungary. He was eventually deported to a labor camp in Germany where he perished.
