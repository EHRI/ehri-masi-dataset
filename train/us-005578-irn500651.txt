Ralph Sommer (1926-1988) was born Rolf Sommer to Moses Sommer and Flora Bloch Sommer. He was born and raised in KÃ¶nigheim, Germany. Flora was able to obtain a visa to travel to the United States through her sister Betty and husband Leo Hanauer, and lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Moses and Ralph continued to live in France. During the occupation, both were sent to Camp des Milles in 1941, where Moses died soon after. Ralph was actually able to obtain a visa through his family, and left the camp, but was not allowed to leave the country. Instead, Ralph joined the French Resistance while living in Chauvigny under the name Jean Sommer. After the occupation he also enlisted in the French Army. After the war, Ralph moved to the United States and married Harriet Sommer and had three children, Michele, Caren, and Richard.

Fred Hanauer (1913-2007) was born in Paris, France before moving to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with his parents Leo and Betty (nee Bloch) Hanauer. During the war, Fred maintained correspondence with his Uncle Julio living in Colombia, along with other friends and family members in order to get relatives out of Europe. Along with efforts in try to help his uncle Moses emigrate, Fred attempted to assist Norbert and Sophie Bloch as well, ultimately failing as the two were sent to Auschwitz where they were killed.
