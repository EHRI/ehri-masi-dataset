By virtue of the decree of March 8, 1946 regarding abandoned and deserted properties, the Main Office of Liquidation seated in Łódź was established, as well as the District Office of Liquidation (OUL) in all provinces, including the Kielce province. Its objective was: 1) to protect abandoned property untill it was taken over by authorities or authorized persons. 2) To manage and compile an inventory of abandoned and deserted properties. 3) To lease and let the above mentioned properties. 4) To sell the estate when the cost of its maintenance was inadequately high compared to its value. The OUL in Kielce had two branch offices in Radom and Częstochowa and district offices operating in counties.
