His father, Ernst Schampanier is the subject of the document regarding the appointment of a cantor at Breslau synagogue. Edith Rosenthal is his daughter, who died in England in 1972. Suzie Rosenthal, the subject for the application of a commemorative bench for victims of the 'Patria' disaster, is her daughter.
