Along with his mother Mirrha, Jewish and originally Russian and father Karl Polzer, non-Jewish and Austrian, the family fled to France in 1938. By 1940, Joseph was placed at Château de Chaumont, a castle used by the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE) that housed thousands of Jewish children. The Polzer family was able to leave by 1941 and came to the United States.
