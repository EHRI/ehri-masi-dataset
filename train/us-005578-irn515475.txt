Irgun Brit Zion photographs

folder

1

Consists of 31 photographs originally gathered by Hana Zippora Trozki, a member of the Irgun Brit Zion, a Zionist youth organization in the Kovno ghetto, which took part in resistance activities. She pasted these photographs of her family and friends before the war and in the ghetto in her journals, which she then hid. Hana was killed in an aktion on July 8, 1944. When her sister, Sara Trozki Koper was liberated from the Stutthof concentration camp, she discovered these journals and removed the pictures, burning the journals for fear of being discovered with them.
