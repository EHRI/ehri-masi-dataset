Marie Rosenberg: documents re restitution claim

1 folder

Nothing is known about the provenance

The claim was rejected by the&nbsp;<em>Entschädigungsamt</em>, Berlin, on the grounds that the last known address of the wholesale livestock business, of which she was part owner, and on which the claim was based, was in the Russian zone of Berlin.<br />The following biographical details have been extracted from papers in this collection.<br /><br />Marie Rosenberg (née Marcus) was born on 19 January 1889. Her husband, Louis, died in 1927. They had two children, Rolf Moritz (later Stanley Sloane) and Ruth. It is assumed that the family is Jewish, though there is no evidence in the documentation for this. She appears to have left Germany shortly after the date on a packing list of her possessions, 15 December 1939 (814/4). The destination is not clear, but subsequent, post-war documentation reveals that she was resident in London and that she remained there until at least 1955 but no later than 1962, during which time she was in New York, living close to her son. The fate of her daughter is not known, beyond the fact that by 1937 she was married to someone by the name of Schmey. The fate of the family after 3 April 1962 (the date of the&nbsp;<em>Entschädigungsamt</em>'s rejection of her restitution claim) is not known.&nbsp;
