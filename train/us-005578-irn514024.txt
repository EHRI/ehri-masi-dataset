Ruth Salton was born January 22, 1927, in Berlin, Germany. She was hidden in Warsaw, Poland, by a Polish family at the time of the Nazi invasion in 1939. She escaped to the Russian-occupied region of Poland and was deported to Siberia until 1944. She moved to Stettin, Germany, and joined a kibbutz there and was later active in the Bricha, helping to smuggle Jews across Europe en route to Palestine (Israel).

The collection consists of 13 images of children and Bricha workers, including Ruth Salton, at Bricha centers and safe houses in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland). They were taken by an unknown amateur photographer from 1946 to 1948.
