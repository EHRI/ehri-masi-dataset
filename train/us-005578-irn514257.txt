Albert Newman was stationed in Biaritz, France, in the winter of 1946. He indicates that Jewish soldiers he knew spent weekends at this Hachshirah bringing food and clothing to the survivors before they were moved on to other parts of the Mediterranean and then to Palestine.

A photograph of Chateau Viellesegure, attached to a page with handwritten song lyrics addressed to American soldiers that indicates when the soldiers leave they should "always remember those who work for Palestine."
