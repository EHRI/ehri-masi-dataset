Frank family collection

1 folder

Heinz and Lucie Frank were the parents of the depositor's husband. Heinz Frank was a lawyer. They lived in Cologne. The advent of the Nazis in 1933 instantly deprived him of his livlihood. He had not served in the German Army during the First World War because he was a mild diabetic. The Frank family had originated in Holland and there still remained some distant cousins. So Heinz and Lucie Frank, with their sons, Hermann and Hans (now John), transferred to Amsterdam. Hermann had just received his doctorate in dentistry. Despite all his efforts the best he could achieve was to work a little clandestinely in a friendly dentist's practice. In 1936 he came to England. Hans left Holland only after the occupation, and with the help of the underground, made his way to Portugal and then, via a year or more in Cuba, to the U.S.A. Herbert and Edith Gross, mentioned in the Red Cross letters, were the niece and husband of Heinz and Lucie Frank. Heinz Ferber was the depositor's brother, who was a trainee in the Philips Works in Eindhoven until the Germans interned and deported all the Jewish employees they could catch.

This collection consists of copy Red Cross telegrams between members of the Frank family during the war and with a people tracing agency after the war.
