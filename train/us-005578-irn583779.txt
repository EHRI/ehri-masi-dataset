Angela Schwartz (born Litza Schwartz, later Weiss, 1923-2013) was born in Beregszasz, Hungary to David Mordechai (b.1888) and Malka (Mergit, b.1898) and had a brother Meier (Paul). Angela was taken to Sömmerda, a subcamp of Buchenwald, and was forced into labor at a munitions factory. After the war, Angela returned to Prague and later married Samuel Weiss (Weis or Weisz, 1923-2010). Samuel was born to Eliyhu (Elius, b. 1894) and Sarina (Shara, nee Birenbaum-Katz, b. 1896) and had one brother, Shlom (Shuli). Angela and Samuel immigrated to Palestine in 1947 and had two sons, Eldad and Michael. Angela’s parents and brother perished in the Holocaust.

The collection includes a booklet created in Sömmerda, a subcamp of Buchenwald, by Angela Schwartz from 1944-1945. The booklet was made from materials in the munitions factory such as paint and paper and includes poems.
