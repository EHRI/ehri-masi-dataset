Anna Gure was born Anna Valerie Gurvich on 5 January 1921 in Kaunas, Lithuania to Maria (n√©e Kantorovich) and Salomon Gurvich. She had one brother, Samuel (later Steven, born 19 December 1935). Both she and her brother survived the Holocaust. After liberation, she worked with Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) in Munich. She immigrated to the United States in 1948.

The collection documents the post-war experiences of Anna Gure (born Anna Gurvich), originally of Kaunas, Lithuania. Documents include a certificate issued by the Central Committee of Liberated Jews in Bavaria stating that Anna was a former prisoner at the Stutthof concentration camp and a Swiss Red Cross document regarding the results of a chest x-ray. Photographs include depictions of Anna in her Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) uniform, likely in the Sankt Ottilien displaced persons camp.
