I'm An American -- Ferdinand Schumann-Heink

On June 22, 1941 Ferdinand Schumann-Heink spoke with William H. Carmichael, District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, about his mother German-American Opera Singer Madame Ernestine Schumann-Heink. The actor shares his family’s immigration story. The two men describe Ernestine as very patriotic. She was so devoted to America that she named her only American-born child George Washington. Ferdinand reveals his family was divided during WWI; and Ernestine always said, “You don’t have to be a soldier to do your duty for this country.”Ferdinand talks about the family still living in Germany. The program concludes with Ferdinand stating our job is to make the American dream for everyone come true. Ferdinand Schumann-Heink was born on August 9, 1893 in Hamburg, Germany. Ferdinand and several of his brothers enlisted in the Army during World War I. He went on to become a prolific actor with more than 65 films to his credit. His mother, Ernestine Schumann-Heink (b. Ernestine Amalie Pauline Rössler) was born on June 15, 1861 in Libeň, Kingdom of Bohemia to a Jewish mother and non-Jewish father. At the age of 13, she began voice lessons with retired opera singer Marietta LeClair. She secured a position at the Hamburg Opera in 1883. Ernestine was asked to sing without rehearsal the title role in Carmen; which she did to great acclaim. The rising star was offered a ten-year contract for her performance. Ernestine went on to be hailed by critics in Europe and the U.S. as “the world’s outstanding counteralto”. However, those who knew her on stage or by reputation called her “Mother” or “Madame”, reflecting the respect she inspired.
