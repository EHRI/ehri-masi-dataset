Eric (Erich) Ungar (1926- ) was born in Vienna to Isadore (Isidor, 1892-1978) and Sabine (1896-1980) Ungar and had a younger brother named Fred (Fritz, 1931- ). His family left Vienna in November 1939 and settled in St. Louis. Sabine’s parents, Moritz (Max, 1869-1942) and Charlotte Schlesinger (1869-1942), were deported from Vienna to Theresienstadt in July 1942. Moritz died there in September 1942, and Charlotte was sent to Auschwitz in 1944 and killed. Isadore’s oldest sister, Berta Bienenfeld (1877-1941), was deported with her husband Max (1877-1941) to Kovno (Kaunas) in November 1941 and killed upon arrival. Another sister, Gisela Kohn (1890-1944), was deported to Theresienstadt in August 1942, transferred to Auschwitz, and killed. Her daughter Anny (Ann Goldsmith, 1923- ) escaped to England on a Kindertransport in 1939 and immigrated to the United States after the war. Isadore’s youngest sister, Rosa Fleischmann (1895-1970s), escaped to England with her husband Roman and son Ernstl (Ernest) and lived in Leeds.

The Ungar family papers consist of original correspondence received by Eric Ungar’s family in St. Louis from their Ungar and Schlesinger relatives in Austria and England between 1939 and 1944 as well as a copy of a family history compiled by Eric Ungar. The correspondence describes life in wartime Austria and England, particularly the suffering and deprivation of the Schlesinger grandparents in Vienna, relates emigration efforts and complications, and asks for and relays news about family members, including those sent to Theresienstadt, Poland, and Lithuania. The correspondence also reflects the challenges Ungar’s family faced in St. Louis. The family history includes Ungar’s family overview and family tree, copies of the original correspondence, and Ungar’s translations of that correspondence created in 1996 and 1998.
