Das Geheimnis des Judentums

1 electronic resource (47 pages)

The file contains a report regarding the effect of the Freemasons in Russia after the revolution of 1917. Furthermore connections of Freemasons and Jews are mentioned and their alleged effect on politics in Russia. In 1917 the author of the report got a lot of secrets documents from the Russian Ministry of the Interior regarding the 'Jewish question'. Among this documents he found the paper from 1895 entitled as "Das Geheimnis des Judentums". In the Bern trial this document played an important role, as Dr. Henry Sliosberg argued this was the prototype of the 'Protocols of the wise man of Zion'. He testified that the “Protocols” were created and distributed by Czarist secret operatives who tried to stem the oncoming revolution by making the Jews scapegoats of the hard times in Russia. Based on this statement the author explains how the 'Protocols' were used in Russia and explained its development and distribution process. The author also wrote a whole chapter about Siliosberg and the antisemitism in Russian political areas. In detail it is described how antisemitism grew in Russia, how politicians and institutions, like the police, used it to gain power or to use their power. Conspiracy theories against Jews and Freemasons were used on daily bases, as he argues.
