Consists of a memoir, 140 pages, entitled "Memoirs," by Dr. Leo Komar, which he wrote in Israel in 1995. The memoir describes Dr. Komar's experiences growing up in Poland between the wars, his extended family, his schooling, his immigration to England in 1933, and his memories of attending medical school in Glasgow. He finished medical school and joined the British Merchant Navy, serving all over the world until 1946. He resumed his medical work in Canada, living in Vancouver from 1955-1992. The memoir also describes Dr. Komar's thoughts about Israel and a history of his family's experiences during the Holocaust, during which many of them perished.
