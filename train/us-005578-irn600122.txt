Ghetto Songs Sung by Survivors

In 1947, Kaczerginski traveled to displaced persons camps in the American zone of occupied Germany and recorded Holocaust survivors singing ghetto songs. These recordings were given to the Central Jewish Historical Commission in Munich. Upon dissolution of Central Jewish Hisorical Commission, the recordings were transferred to the Yad Vashem Archives in Israel and cataloged as part of the archival collection M-1. Shmaryahu (Shmerke) Kaczerginski (b. Vilna, 1908, d. Argentina, 1954) was a poet, musician, and cultural activist. A participant in the Vilna Ghetto uprising, after the war he founded the first post-Holocaust Jewish museum in Europe.
