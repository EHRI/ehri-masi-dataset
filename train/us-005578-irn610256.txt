Consists of color copies of report cards, a Swiss protective pass (Schutzpass), handwritten poems, postcards, letters, and photographs. The collection was created and owned by Ágnes Grünwald, who was sixteen years old when she was deported from Budapest in October 1944. The postcards, poems, and letters were sent from a forced march. Grünwald perished in a concentration camp (likely Bergen-Belsen).
