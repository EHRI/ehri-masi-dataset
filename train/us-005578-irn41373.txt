Consists of one memoir, 279 pages, entitled "A Rejected Stone: My Life" by Ben-Zion Schuster, originally of Ozrian, Poland. He describes pre-war Jewish life in his shtetl, a major town fire in 1932, moving to Luck to study in a yeshiva, and returning to Holob to help his family. He describes the Soviet occupation of the region after 1939 and the German invasion of the region in June 1941. Mr. Schuster fled into the Soviet Union and traveled through the Stalingrad region before arriving, first in Tashkent, and then in Tshertshikh and Chelyabinsk, where he performed forced labor. He joined the Polish Army and returned to Luck, where he discovered what happened to his family and his community, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust. He married his wife Deborah, and after traveling through post-war Poland, they went to the Neu Freimann and Pocking displaced persons camps. The couple immigrated to the United States in 1947. The memoir was written in November 1990.
