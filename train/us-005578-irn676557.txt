Cukunft (Youth Union "Future") began to operate on a larger scale in 1919. The first groups of young people describing themselves as "Little Bund" began to be created at the beginning of the 20th century in Belarus, Włocławek and Lublin. Ideologically and organisationally, Cukunft was formed in 1916. In the mid-1920s, it brought together over 3,000 members in 70 field organizations, and in the 1930s - over 10,000 members in nearly 200 organizations. At its head were the National Congress and the Central Committee with the secretary. From 1929, Cukunft delegates also entered the Bund. During World War II, the organization took part in the Jewish armed resistance. Together with the home Bund, she created four battle groups within the ŻOB. After the war, Cukunft resumed operations. The Committee operated in 18 cities. Unfortunately, the ŻIH Archive did not contain any documents from any field offices. Like the Bund, Cukunft was also subjected to pressure from the PPR and then the PZPR. In January 1949, when the last Bund Congress adopted a resolution on the dissolution of the party, Cukunft ceased to exist. [Source: Polski Słownik Judaistyczny, oprac. Z. Borzymińska, R.
