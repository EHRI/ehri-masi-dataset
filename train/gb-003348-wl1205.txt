Julian David Layton was born Loewenstein in 1904 to parents who had come to England from Frankfurt in 1893 with the family firm of Loewenstein, Hoskins. According to a Alan Leopold Berton, nephew of Julian Layton, and executor to his will, and one of the depositors to this collection, Leopold Loewenstein, Layton's father, changed his name to Layton in 1917. According to Julian Layton's cv he changed his name by deed poll on 30 August 1921, his brother, Ralph, having already changed his in September 1914. Julian's mother was the granddaughter of Samson Raphael Hirsch.<p align="left">Layton became a stockbroker and a member of the London Stock Exchange from 1930, a partner in the firm R. Layton and Co. from 1933. He spent several years working in banks and stock broking firms in Germany and France.<br></p><p align="left">The relationship between the Rothschilds and the Loewensteins began in Frankfurt and continued in London. It proved to be important with regard to the rescue of Jews in Europe as evidenced in the saga of the 'Cedar Boys'- the project in which Layton helped rescue 28 German Jewish boys and girls, who resided at the Rothschild's estate.<br></p><p align="left">Layton played a vital role in securing the release of hundreds of Jewish internees in Australia during the war years.<br><br>Otto Schiff of the German Jewish Aid Committee, who had known Layton already for a long time, had requested that Layton go to Canberra to persuade the Australian government to accept many German Jewish refugees. Much later, after the outbreak of war, Layton, on account of his experience dealing with refugees and his management of the Kitchener Camp for Refugees at Richborough, Kent, was sent by the British Government as a Home Office Liaison officer to facilitate the repatriation of the internees. He also assisted in obtaining compensation for those who suffered a loss during the 'Dunera' scandal, in which 3 British soldiers were court-martialed for the brutal treatment and robbery of refugees.<br><br>

<p>This collection of papers documents the activities of Lt. Colonel Julian Layton, a British born Jew, of German Jewish origins, who assisted many German Jewish refugees before the war and internees during the war. The collection comprises several deposits from different sources.</p>
