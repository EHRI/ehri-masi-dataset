Schoenfeld and Mandelbrot families collection

oversize boxes

4

Collection of documents, correspondence, photographs, papers, negatives, newspapers and clippings, and other assorted materials which primarily document the experiences of Siegfried, Elsa (nee Schonfeld) and Liselotte Mandelbrot of Stuttgart and their friends and family, and the Mandelbrot's attempts to flee Nazi Germany. The family had visas for the United States, but the papers expired before they could get out. They were deported to Theresienstadt on August 22, 1942, and from there to Auschwitz on October 12, 1944 where they were killed. Elsa Mandelbrot is the donor's father's half sister. The collection was found by Joachim Hahn in the attic of a home, while he was doing research for a book. Hahn placed a noticed in the "Das Aufbau" newspaper looking for relatives of the Schonfeld Mandelbrods. The donor's uncle saw the ad and received the materials before giving them to his nephew.
