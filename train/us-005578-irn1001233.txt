Hitler speech

Hitler speaks, good CUs. Speech: "It is not the economists, or professors or artists...that have raised the German people, but the political soldiers of the NSDAP... (cheers) ...The citizens who say yes to the Fuehrer, but say the Party is something else, know the Fuehrer is the Party and the Party is the Fuehrer... (cheers) ...I believe and I know that the Party will lead Germany to a bright future..." Very good quotes, gestures, and expressions.
