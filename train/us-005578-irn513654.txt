Ella Lidsky (born Ella Cwik) was bornin 1925 in Vilna, Poland (now Vilnius , Lithuania) to Leib and Szejna Cwik. She was in school in the Soviet Union when World War II started. Her parents and six sisters perished during the Holocaust, but she and her older brother, Pinchas, who had immigrated to Palestine in the 1930s, survived. Ella graduated from Odessa Pedagogical Institute after the war and worked as an elementary school teacher in Poland and then in Israel after she immigrated in 1957. She immigrated to the United States in 1962, settled in New York City, and married Alexander Lidsky, a physician who was also a Holocaust survivor from Vilna.

The collection consists of two photographs: a formal picture showing the donor's father, Rebbe Leib Cwik, in a jacket and hat and the other picture of five women, one young boy, and one young girl in three hammocks.
