Correspondence relates primarily to Dutch volunteers of the Nationalsozialisches Kraftfahrkorps (NSKK - National Socialist Motor Corps), with their families in the Netherlands. It also includes correspondence of members of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB- National Socialist Movement), who emigrated to the German refugee camps after September 1944.
