I'm An American -- Yolanda Mero-Irion

On April 20, 1941 Yolanda Mero-Irion spoke with William H. Marshall, Assistant District Director of Immigration at Ellis Island, about the responsibility she feels to protect democracy and the United States. Mero-Irion explains why she feels American citizens will not sit by, like Europeans, and allow democracy to be destroyed. She admits her first impression of America was not positive, however she fell in love with the country and a man. The pianist explains how America welcomes artists and musicians. She also shares how she believes artists can excel in a democratic environment. Mero-Irion concludes the segment by declaring she loves America and is grateful for what she has received. She adds she is eager to give back. Yolanda Mero-Irion (b. Mérő Yolanda) was born on August 30, 1887 in Budapest, Hungary to Jewish parents. At the age of 8, she began studying at the National Conservatory and by 15 she was touring with Dresden Philharmonic. The classic pianist moved to America in 1900. Six weeks later she fell in love, got married and became a naturalized citizen. She played in concerts under the baton of Gustav Mahler, Leopold Stokowski and others. Mero-Irion became the world’s only female impresario, at that time, when she co-founded the New Opera Company. The pianist was also an activist and philanthropist. She championed for the improvement of quality radio content, launching attacks against soap operas and advertising. She also provided support for destitute musicians through the co-creation of the Musicians Emergency Fund.
