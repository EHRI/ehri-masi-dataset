Państwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau

This collection is comprised of photocopied documents and copy print photographs detailing the fates of Jehovah’s Witness from the villages of Wisła and Ustroń, in Cieszyn County, Poland during the Holocaust. Materials include name lists of men and women from Wisła and Ustroń who were interned and murdered at KZ Auschwitz and their corresponding death records as copied from the Nazi death log (sterbebuch). Other name lists include children from Wisła sent to Łódź as part of the German youth camp (Jugenverwahrlager Litzmannstadt). Associated with the name lists is a series of copy prints of prisoner mugshots depicting many of the named individuals, photocopies of outgoing correspondence from some of the prisoners, and photocopies of primary source documents detailing the biographical information for many included on the lists. Documents have stamped citations from the host archives, which includes Auschwitz Birkenau State Museum and the State Archives in Katowice.
