The archive was located for 70 years in the storage room of the local Greek police station.

The Italians invaded the islands of Dodecanese in 1912 during the Italian-Ottoman War. The territory was annexed to the Italian Kingdom in 1924. All the administrative apparatus was dominated by an Italian Governor who exercised "full civil powers" and responded only to the Italian minister of Foreign Affairs. The islands were conquered by the Germans (1943-1945) and then by the English military forces (1945-1947). The Dodecanese were incorporated to Greece in 1947.

The archive contains approx. 80.000 personal files (for 130.000 inhabitants). It contains reports on political events, social and ethnic groups (Greeks, Turks, Jews and other foreigners) and companies, juridical decisions, information on the antifascist activities, the Jewish community, cases related to full Italian citizenship and the special local form of citizenship (Cittadinanza Egea Italiana).
