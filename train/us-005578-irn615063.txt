The Reichsarchiv Potsdam served from 1919 to 1945 as a central archive for all acts of the German Reich. Among the tasks of the archive was the collection and cataloging of all produced since 1871 records of the German Reich, especially the files of the recently ended World War II. In addition, it should provide users with information and allow an exploration of imperial history-especially the history of the World War.

Correspondence with other archives about exchange of literature, transfer of documents captured in France, and other matters; with the Reichsinnenministerium about transfer of records seized in Poland; and correspondence of the Reichskommissariat Niederlande with Nazi organizations about the occupation of Flanders; circulars by NSDAP regarding trainings, a speech by R. Hess (June 14, 1935); orders by H. Frank, 9 Dec. 1939; lists of military campaigns; antifascist leaflets of WWII, 1939. Also includes Catholic propaganda and brochures on Pius XII, British propaganda and pamphlets, a diary of unknown military unit, reports and newspaper clippings. Note: USHMM Archives holds only selected records.
