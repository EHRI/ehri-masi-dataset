The Bund Schweizerischer Jüdischer Frauenorganisationen (BSJF) was founded by Elisabeth Weingarten and established in 1924 as an umbrella organisation for 7 Jewish women's associations in Switzerland. The Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO) and Emunah joined BSJF later on. Its goal was to represent Jewish women's interests before various Jewish community organisations and in the national and international arena. BSJF took part in protests against Jewish and non-Jewish women's oppression and human rights violations. During World War II, the BSJF took care of Jewish refugees' children and provided financial support to Jewish refugees. In the 1970s and 1980s, the BSJF was involved in aid actions for Israel and for Soviet and Yugoslav Jews. The Bund Schweizerischer Jüdischer Frauenorganisationen (BSJF), until 1995, was known as the Bund Schweizerischer Israelitischer Frauenvereine (BSIF).

The collection consists of the complete working papers of the Bund Schweizerischer Jüdischer Frauenorganisationen (BSJF), including minutes, reports, correspondence, publications, etc.
