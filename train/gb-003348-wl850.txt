Otto Bendix: letter to wife

1 folder

The letter was part of the possessions of Otto Bendix' former wife who died fairly young, having suffered the Russian occupation of Berlin and having been implicated in an East German spy-ring, incarcerated and subsequently exonerated. The depositor, who was a close friend of the latter, received the letter from her niece.

Mrs E. Lintello, the depositor, describes in a letter to the Wiener Library in 1985 how Otto Bendix had been 'a rich and spoilt, fun-loving man of the world'. She describes his wife as 'her dearest and closest friend...[that she was] 20 years his junior, totally aryan'. She also describes how she never heard from her husband again and that all efforts to trace him were unsuccessful.<br><br><div>The <em>Gedenkbuch Berlins der j√ºdischen Opfer des Nationalsozialismus</em> lists Otto Bendix as having died on 8 January 1943, having been transported from his home in Berlin, Wilmersdorf on 3 October 1942. The letter can therefore be dated at some time shortly before the latter date.

This original farewell note (with transcription) documents the last moments of Otto Bendix' life in Berlin prior to deportation to Theresienstadt in 1942.
