Albert Craig Levinson was a member of the 8th Infantry and was present at the Ohrdruf concentration camp shortly after liberation. He likely worked as a clerk/typist.

Consists of one typed testimony, three pages, dictated by Dr. Kurt Grunwald, a Czech physician, related to his Holocaust experiences in Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and Ohrdruf. The testimony was typed by Albert Craig Levinson, a member of the 8th Infantry Division, after the liberation of Ohrdruf. Dr. Grunwald later reunited with his surviving son, Misa (Frank), whom he mourns in the testimony, believing Misa to have been killed at Auschwitz. Also includes a copyprint photograph of Albert Craig Levinson.
