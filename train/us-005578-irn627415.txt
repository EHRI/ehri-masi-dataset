Cookbook primarily written by Rosel (Ruzena) Benedikt Neuburg (Neuburgova) with other pages inserted most likely written by her mother Elise Rindskopf Benedikt. Inscribed and sent by Rosel to her daughter Elisabeth “Liesel” Amalie Margaret Neuburg in April 1942. In 1938, Elisabeth had been sent by her mother from their home in Vienna, Austria to England, and she remained in London throughout the war. Rosel was deported to an unknown camp from Theresienstadt on May 25, 1942 and did not survive the Holocaust. Includes photographs of Rosel Neuburg and her children Elisabeth and Franz, whose fate is also unknown.
