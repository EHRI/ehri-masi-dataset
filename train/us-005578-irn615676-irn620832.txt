I'm An American -- Fred Perry

On May 4, 1941 Fred Perry spoke with Marshall E. Dimock, Second Assistant Secretary of Labor, about his journey to American citizenship. Perry tells Mr. Dimock about his first impressions of the country and why he chose to discard his British citizenship. He also reveals how his family feels about his naturalization. Perry goes on to share how competitive sporting tours can strengthen relationships between countries. He compares Americanism and totalitarianism with a sports analogy. The professional tennis player warns Americans of dictators wanting to expand their control in the Western Hemisphere. Perry concludes the segment by referencing the defeat of France as an example of what can happen when a country is not prepared to meet might with might. Fred Perry was born on May 18, 1909 in Stockport, England. He began playing lawn tennis on his familyâ€™s public estate. In 1928 and 1929, his amateur sporting career catapulted when he won medals in the single, double and team events at the World Table Tennis Championship. He attracted adoring fans at Wimbledon because he did not have a privileged background. Between 1934 and 1936, he won three consecutive Wimbledon men's titles and the title of World Number 1. He also won the U.S. Open (1933, 1934, 1936), French Open (1935) and Australian Open (1934). In 1938 and 1941, he was awarded the prestigious US Pro title. He is the only player in his era to win eight Grand Slams, ten Majors and two Pro Slams. Fred Perry was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1975. His greatest legacy is the iconic self-titled sportswear line.
