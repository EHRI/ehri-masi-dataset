Buchwald family: papers and correspondence

1 folder

The biographical background of the Buchwald family is somewhat patchy. The Jewish couple Ludwig and Katerina Buchwald originally lived in Bratislava. They had two children: Rosa (born in 1925) and Wilhelm Theodor (Viliam Teodor) (born in 1929). It appears from the correspondence that Katerina Buchwald fled with her son Wilhelm to England in February 1939. Shortly after their arrival they moved to Manchester. Ludwig Buchwald followed in April 1939. There is confusion in the surviving correspondence regarding the fate of the second child. Ludwig Buchwald passed away during the war years under unknown circumstances.
