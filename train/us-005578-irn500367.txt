Gustav Spitzer lived in Chicago in the late 1930â€™s. Though his last name was Spitzer, he was unrelated to any of the people from he received letters from at this time.

The Gustav Spitzer letters contain correspondence sent to Gustav Spitzer while he was living in Chicago from 1938-1939. The letters come from Vienna and Prague, all from Jewish citizens with the same surname of Spitzer. Though they have no relation to Gustav, they are requesting that he assist them in granting them affidavits so they may immigrate to the United States. The letters show the desperation and discrimination that Jews were facing at this time in Austria and Czechoslovakia, that they would explore any possibility to escape their conditions.
