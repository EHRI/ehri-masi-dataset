Adolf Fingrut owned a successful photography studio in Rembert贸w, Poland before the war. In August 1942, during the liquidation of the Rembert贸w ghetto, Adolf escaped and received false papers provided to him by his non-Jewish Polish girlfriend (later wife) Michalina Jarowszewska. He fled to Warsaw and stayed in Prague until November 1942, where Michalina's cousin arranged a job for Adolf taking photographs in Opole, where he remained until liberation. After the war, he reopened his studio in Rembert贸w.

Collection of photographs documenting the experiences of Adolf Fingrut during the time period surrounding the Holocaust. Some of these photos bear the stamp of Adolf's photo studio in Rembert贸w, Poland.
