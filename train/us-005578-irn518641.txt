folder

1

Consists of six photographs of the aftermath of the Allied bombings of Dresden, Germany, in February 1945, specifically the mass burning of victims of the bombings, as well as one official Nazi report, one page, dated March 22, 1945, describing the bombings and giving the number of bombs, the number of victims, and the damage done to the city. Also includes one handwritten poem, in English. The collection presumably belonged to Robert Lunow, a native German and the bookbinder of the Folger Shakespeare Library from 1948 until his death in 1971. These items were found in the bindery in May 1972.
