Consists of one memoir, 5 pages, in English, written by Samuel Finkelstein, originally of Rzeszów, Poland. In the memoir, Mr. Finkelstein describes his family's pre-war life in Rzeszów, being forced into the ghetto, and how many struggled to get identity cards designating them as necessary labor. In 1943, Mr. Finkelstein was deported to Płaszów and from there, to Mauthausen. He was sent to the subcamp of Linz, where he worked in the underground tunnels before his liberation in May 1945. He traveled to Italy and lived in the UNRRA camps in Ancona and Roma before immigrating to Palestine in 1946 and fighting in the Israeli War of Independence.
