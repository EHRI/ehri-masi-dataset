Hitler at Siemens factory

Hitler's speech to Siemens factory workers. Hitler (on circular platform) starts off calmly, becoming more emphatic: "I want not only peace and quiet/order, but also what is our right....I'm not interested in the intellectual, I'm interested in the German people...." Shots of the workers in white lab coats listening to his speech.
