The fonds consists out of 490 linear meters of processed and inventoried documents. 28 linear meters are unprocessed and inaccessible.

The documents from the Ministry of Public Works and its following Ministries of Economy and Work as well as the Ministry of Traffic and Technique were handed over to the State Central Archives (Státní ústřední archiv) today National archives (Národní archiv) between 1952 and 1971. The main part of the collection was processed and inventoried in 1962. Supplements were processed and inventoried in 1975 and 1978.

The Czechoslovak Ministry of Public Works was founded shortly after the independence from Austria-Hungary in autumn 1918. The main agenda of the Ministry was the improvement of the infrastructure in the new country especially in the less developed parts of Slovakia and Carpatho-Ukraine. During the so called 2nd Czechoslovak Republic (October 1938-March 1939) the Ministry of Public Works lost building activities fro its agenda. Due to Reinhard Heydrich`s reform of the Protectorate government the Ministry of Public Works was dissolved in 1942.

The Ministry of Public Works played a minor role in the persecution of the Jews in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Although it was responsible for the development of infrastructure also in the years of the German occupation during taht Jews were used for Forced labour in this field, it seems that no documents in the collection are referring to that. According to the finding only boxes 2599 and 1649 are dealing with "the Jewish question".
