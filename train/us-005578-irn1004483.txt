Propaganda about Austria

The symbol of the Vaterlandisches Front (Fatherland Front) appears on the screen, followed by a Star of David. Shot of Kurt Schuschnigg, whose name the narrator says in a menacing voice. The next section shows clergy celebrating the concordat (the 1933 concordat with Austria? Schuschnigg is present in two scenes). A series of Fatherland Front flags parts symbolically to reveal a Jewish man walking in Vienna, followed by a "Judisches Geschaeft" sign in the window of the Caf√© Rembrandt. Jews in the streets of the Jewish Quarter of Vienna. Shops with Jewish names, including Geza Basch and Samuel Halpern. The camera pans over from the name of Samuel Halpern to the words Palaestina Produkte (also in Yiddish).
