Barbara Sadagopan was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1923, to a Jewish mother and a Catholic father, the graphic artist, Helmut Krommer. The family was persecuted becasue her mother was Jewish. In 1933, they were forced to flee the Kunstlerkolonie in Berlin and find refuge in Czechoslovakia. When Germany annexed Prague in March 1939, the family fled to Yugoslavia because Helmet's anti-Nazi activities put him on the Gestapo's wanted list. Barbara, her sisters, and her mother were able to obtain visas and immigrate to England. Barbara spent the war years in England and immigrated to the United States in 1948. Her uncle, Arnold Weisz, apparently died at Sachsenhausen.
