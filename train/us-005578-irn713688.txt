Felix Kasprzak collection

folder

1

Contains two copies of an undated personal narrative written by donorâ€™s father, Felix Joseph Kasprzak, an American born in New Jersey who moved to Poland in 1933 with his Polish-born mother so he could attend school. Living in Pabianice, after the German invasion of Poland, Felix fled to Warsaw and then back to Pabianice. He was eventually arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps and, according to his writings, was able to leave German occupation and return to the United States in 1942. His writings also describe bombings and chaos that ensued as the Germans bombed Poland. The two accounts differ slightly.
