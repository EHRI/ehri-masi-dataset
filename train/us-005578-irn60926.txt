Franz Goldberg (b. 1899) was born in Saaz (present day Å½atec, Czech Republic). He was a professor at a business school in Vienna, Austria. By 1939 he had lost his job and tried unsuccessfully to emigrate from Austria to the United States. He was deported from Vienna to the Izbica ghetto in Poland and then deported to the Majdanek concentration camp in May 1942. He likely perished there on 20 August 1942.

The letter and resume are addressed to Benjamin Davis at Walton High School in Bronx, New York, from Franz Goldberger in Vienna, Austria; dated January 13, 1940. Franz wrote to Benjamin asking for assistance in receiving an affidavit of support from either the recipient or anyone else who may be of assistance, in order to emigrate from Austria. The resume includes Franz's photograph and states that he was born in Saaz, Germany on August 6, 1899.
