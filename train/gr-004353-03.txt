As the classification of the archive is an ongoing procedure, the Service of Diplomatic and Historical Archives was not able to give a number.

The Greek Embassy in London was among the first diplomatic missions established after the foundation of the Hellenic Kingdom in 1828. Distinguished Greek Ambassadors at the Court of St James were Spyridon Trikoupis (1834-1837, 1841-1843, 1849-1862), who also served as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Charilaos Trikoupis (1862-1865) who served seven times as Prime Minister, Ioannis Gennadius (1910-1918), a seminal literary figure in the UK, and Nobel laureate George Seferis (1957-1962).
