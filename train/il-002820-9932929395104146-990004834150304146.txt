The Position of the Jews in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (October)

1 electronic resource (22 pages)

The file contains a report of 1937 about the position of Jews in Yugoslavia written in German. The Jewish Central information Office published every month a new report, regarding the situation of Jews in Germany or Europe. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). This report is devided into 3 chapters, 'Political overview', 'The organisation of the Jewish communities' and 'German refugees in Yugoslavia'. For the evaluation of the situation of Jews in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia it was important to recognize that the state was authoritarian and that ment not only the economic relations between Yugoslavia, Germany and Italy had a strong impact but it also ment that it might come to a convergency of ideologies, so the author argues. In addition the German propaganda machine was already working in Yugoslavia. Nevertheless the Kingdom of Yugoslavia attempted to maintain neutrality and Yugoslav policy was not anti-Semitic: for instance, Yugoslavia opened its borders to Austrian Jews following the Anschluss. Furthermore reports can be seen regarding the situation of Jews in Luxembourg, especially in the border areas to Germany. In addition a report regarding Jewish governmental authorities in Russia is attached. As the defamation was spreading that Russia was governed by Jews, the JCIO published a report based on informations regarding the governmental authorities in Russia to wipe away this falsehood. On account of this also some information to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are given.
