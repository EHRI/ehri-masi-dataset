Greta Braude Heiman was born Margaret Meyer in Bonn in 1931 to World War I veteran and cattle dealer Harry (Sally) Meyer (1887-1960) and Erna Michel Meyer (1897-1993). The Meyer family lived in Hamm an der Sieg until Nazi persecutions led them to immigrate to Milwaukee via the Netherlands in September 1938. Harry’s siblings Emil Meyer and Clara Herz perished in the Holocaust along with their spouses and children as did his brother in law Theo Tobias and niece Ellen Tobias. His brothers Moritz and Fritz Meyer survived the Holocaust with their wives and children and their sister Hedwig Tobias. Erna’s siblings Helma Hertz and Joseph Michel immigrated to the United States in 1937 and 1938 following the death of their mother, Mathilde Michel, in 1937.
