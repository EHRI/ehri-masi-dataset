Löbl family papers

1 folder + 2 photos

<div>Robert Löbl was the son of Oskar (1893-1942) and Hella Löblova (1898-1942) whom Mrs Roan, a neighbour of the donor, met whilst the latter was on holiday in Czechoslovakia some time in the 1930s. When the situation for Czech Jews became increasingly intolerable after the Nazi annexation of the Sudetenland, Robert’s parents wrote to the donor’s parents, the Monnickendams, on the recommendation of Mrs Roan, asking if they could take Robert into their family home at Edgware, Middlesex. The Monnickendams duly obliged and Robert arrived by plane at Croydon, aged 14 years. He went to school and then later bakery school- the Monnickendams were bakers. He later joined the Czech army in Britain and was released in Prague after the war.</div><div><br /></div><div>He married Stella Michelova and they had two children. They remained in Prague.&nbsp;</div>
