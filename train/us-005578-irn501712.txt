Eugene Miller (1923- ) was born Eugeniusz Rozenblum in Merecz (Merkinė), Lithuania, to Marcus (Mordechai) and Ida Rozenblum, but his parents registered his birth and raised him in Łódź. His family was forced into the Łódź ghetto in 1940. He continued to attend school until the ghetto school closed, and then he worked in the ghetto's labor, economic, and fire departments. Both of his parents perished in the ghetto, his father following a beating in 1941 and his mother following illness and starvation in 1943. Miller was deported to Birkenau in August 1944, but after two weeks he was transferred to Kaufering to perform forced labor for the Moll Kommando. After the war, he moved to Frankfurt, married Julia Zekcer, immigrated to the United States in 1949, completed his earning his PhD at the University of Chicago, and changed his name to Eugene Miller.

The Eugene Miller collection comprises subject files documenting Miller's interest in the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Treblinka; the Łódź ghetto (including images of Chaim Rumkowski and Hans Biebow); other ghettos and camps; war crimes procedures against John Demjanjuk and Adolf Eichmann; investigations into the identity and fate of Josef Mengele; Heinrich Himmler; Martin Borman; and SS personnel and organization. Most of these records are reproductions of original materials. The collection also includes original photographs of Jewish Holocaust survivors from Poland who studied medicine and science in Germany after the war.
