Daisy Grob was born Daisy Elizabeth Goldszpiner on 24 April 1931 in Warsaw, Poland to Blanche and Mitchell Goldszpiner. In 1939, Blanche was an American working at the American Consulate in Warsaw with Dr. Waldemar J.A. Wickman. Her husband Mitchell had returned to the United States in April 1939 to attend the World's Fair on business. He was supposed to return to Warsaw on 15 September 1939. After the war broke out, Blanche was asked to leave the country with the diplomatic mission, but she thought that being an American would protect her and her daughter Daisy. By the time they wanted to leave, it was too late. Because they were Jewish, Blanche and Daisy were forced into the Warsaw Ghetto. Blanche placed Daisy in hiding near Warsaw in 1943, and she survived the war. Blanche was deported to the Dachau concentration camp where she perished.

Dr. Waldemar J. A. Wickman was the U.S. Public Health Service Medical Officer attached to the American Consulate in Warsaw who gave psychological testing to people leaving Poland for the United States.

The collection consists of a photograph depicting eight year-old Daisy Goldszpiner (later Daisy Grob), the daughter of Blanche Goldszpiner, posing with a dog in front of a tree in pre-war Warsaw.
