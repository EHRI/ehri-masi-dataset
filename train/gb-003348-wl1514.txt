Wilfrid Israel: correspondence

1 folder

Wilfrid Israel, born in London in 1899 to an English Jewess and a German Jew, enjoyed a very privileged existence growing up in Berlin, where he inherited the family business, the famous N. Israel department store, with its 2000 employees. Whilst conforming to family expectations, he entertained interests in socialist Zionism, pacifism and internationalism.

This collection consists of original correspondence from Wilfrid Israel to Diana Hopkinson, English friends of the former, who first met at Lola Hahn Warburg's Wannsee home.
