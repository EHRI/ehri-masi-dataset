Describes Abram Korn's (1923-1972) experiences in Lipno, Poland, during the German invasion of Poland; Korn and his family's internment in the Kutno Ghetto; his deportation to and experiences in various concentration camps, including Gross-Rosen, Auschwitz-Birkenau, Hirschberg, Bolkenhain, Ohrdruf, and Buchenwald; Korn's involvement with resistance activities in Auschwitz and that camp's Sonderkommando uprising; a death march; and Korn's liberation and his immigration to the United States in 1949. The memoir's "Introduction" and "Epilogue," written by Joseph Korn, Abram's son, describe both how Joseph went to Europe to better understand Abram's experiences and Abram's life in the United States. The collection also contains an earlier version of the memoir.
