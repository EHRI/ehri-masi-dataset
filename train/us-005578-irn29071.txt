Erna Ketchie (1927-2007) was born Erna Engelbrecht to Johann (Hans) and Frieda (née Schwed, 1889-1943) Engelbrecht. Hans was Christian and Frieda was Jewish. The family lived in Frankfurt am Main, Germany prior to World War II where Hans was a hairdresser. During the war, both Hans and Frieda were arrested by the Gestapo. Frieda was arrested in 1941 and sent to Auschwitz in February 1943 where she perished. Hans was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1943. Both Hans and his daughter Erna survived the war. Erna later immigrated to the United States. Frieda’s sisters Kathi, Rosa, and Gutta Schwed all perished at Auschwitz.

The collection primarily consists of correspondence, documents, and photographs related to the Engelbrecht family of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Included are letters exchanged among the family while Johann (Hans) was imprisoned in Buchenwald and his wife Frieda was imprisoned in Frankfurt prior to her deportation to Auschwitz where she perished. Included is the last letter Hans received from Frieda in 1941. Photographs include depictions of Frieda and Hans, and Frieda’s sisters Kathi, Rosa, and Gutta Schwed.
