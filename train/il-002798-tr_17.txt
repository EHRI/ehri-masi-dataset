In the Record Group there is documentation gathered by the Main Commission for Investigation of Crimes against the Polish People, which was active in Poland after World War II.

The Commission gathered much documentation from various sources: documentation from the offices of the German authorities that left Poland with the withdrawal of the Wehrmacht, as well as loot and documentation that came into the hands of the Allied forces. Additionally, the Commission itself gathered much documentation during its visits to persecution sites in Poland, and it received documentation from various bodies, for instance completed questionnaires regarding the persecution of the Jews.
