The Jew Connoisseur

Der Judenkenner

The publication was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1996 by Mark Esterman, the son of Benjamin and Sophie Esterman.

Benjamin and Sophie Esterman were American citizens who were traveling in Europe, and visited Germany in order to see for themselves and to inform others where Nazism was going.
