Roza Chodik was born Roza Einhorn in August 1941 to Bernard and Sara. When she was one year old her parents managed to put her in hiding, and her paternal uncle Jakub Einhorn took her when Roza was 4 years old in October 1945. Jakub had lost his wife and child and remarried Kreindl Frieder. Their son Shaye was born in October 1945. Roza was not aware that she was not Jakub's and Kreindl's daughter by birth.

Collection consists of two photographs depicting Roza Chodik with her paternal uncle's family immediately after the war in Szczecin, Poland in 1946. In these photographs, Roza is standing aside during the birthday party of her cousin Shaye, whom she knew as her brother.
