The Position of the Jews in Germany (June)

1 electronic resource (29 pages)

The file contains a report of 1936 about the position of the Jews in Germany written in English and German. The Jewish Central information Office published every month a new report, regarding the situation of Jews in Germany. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). This report is divided into 13 chapters. The first one is the introduction, than 'in some towns no coal and no Medical Assistance', 'the Consequences of the Nueremberg Laws', 'the secret political police (Gestapo) at work', the economic flight against Jews', 'Sales of Businesses and Dismissals', 'Medical Practitioners', 'Lawyers', 'The chamber of culture Laws', 'Returning and Visiting Emigrants', 'Passports', "stateless' and a Summary. The position of German Jewry seemed to have entered a stage of outward quitness. The Olympiad, which was at 1936 dominating the whole public life in Germany, has forced a cunning change of methods and an outward quit. Efforts were made to show the visitors how peacefully and quitly the Jews live in Germany. But this should not delude anyone into the belief that the fight against the Jews had ceased, so the author argued.
