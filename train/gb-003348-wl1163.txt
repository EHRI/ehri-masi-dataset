2 folders

Little is known about Alfred Pavel Peres save for the fact that he was an international lawyer and that he helped Benes get visas for political liberals. He was a member of the <em>Deutsche Demokratische Freiheitspartei.</em>

These papers document, in part, the activities of Czech exiles in London during the war and the situation in Czechoslovakia in the immediate post war years. The papers include correspondence between Alfred Pavel Peres and the president of Czechoslovakia, Eduard Benes.
