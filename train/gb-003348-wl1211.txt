Joachim Prinz: Miscellaneous papers

1 folder

Nothing is known about the provenance of these papers relating to Joachim Prinz, former rabbi of the Berlin Jewish community.

Joachim Prinz was born in Burchartsdorf, Germany, in 1902, and ordained by the Breslau Jewish Theological Seminary in 1925. In 1926 he became rabbi of the Berlin Jewish community. His adherence to the Zionist movement brought him into conflict with the leaders of the Berlin Jewish community. Prinz continually attacked Nazism from his pulpit, even after Hitler came to power, and was arrested several times by the Gestapo. In 1937 he held his last meeting with his congregation before emigrating to the U.S.. The meeting was spied on by Adolf Eichmann, who reported to the Gestapo that Prinz's plan to emigrate proved that an international Jewish conspiracy had New York headquarters. Prinz was subsequently arrested by the Gestapo and expelled from Germany. In 1939 he was appointed rabbi at Temple B'nai Abraham, Newark, New Jersey.
