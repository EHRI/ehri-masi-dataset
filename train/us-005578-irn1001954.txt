Hitler's first speech as Chancellor, Berlin Sportpalast

Nazi party rally in the crowded Berlin Sportpalast on February 10, 1933. Hitler in uniform explains the ideological reasons for the Nazi rise to power and their main political aims. He announces the indictment of the politicians responsible for the evils of the Weimar Republic and promises to 'resurrect' a "Neue Deutsche Reich" [new German Empire] undivided and rooted in 'healthy' soil. He does not openly address the Jewish question. Hitler closes with the last words of the Lord's Prayer and Amen. The audience of civilians and uniformed SA and SS rises, cheers, shouts 'Heil,' and gives the Nazi salute (several times during the speech). This is Hitler's "Regierungserklaerung" [State of the Union address] to the German people after being appointed Reich Chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933. It is also a part of the campaign effort before the parliamentary elections slated for March 5, 1933. Hitler blames the "Maenner des November 1918" [men of November 1918] for the innocently lost war and the suppressive treaty of Versailles. In addition, he blames the years of political turmoil and cultural decadence on the Communists and the inflation and unemployment on the financial powers. The Germans allegedly lost their freedom, their pride, their history, and their culture in the fourteen years of the "Systemzeit" [period of the political system] of the Weimar republic, only to be 'reborn' as a strong and proud nation under Hitler as the savior of Germany. The address and commentary by Goebbels was broadcast on radio and public loudspeakers (with an audience propagandistically estimated by Goebbels as up to 20 million).
