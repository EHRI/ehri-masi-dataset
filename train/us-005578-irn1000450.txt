Fighting in Warsaw

Soldiers walking through rubble. Tossing hand grenades. Searching house-to-house. Mostly MS and MLS. Town is deserted. Flamethrowers. The last image is of a German eagle and Swastika, indicating the triumph of the Nazis. Footage and narration seem to indicate that this shows the German response to the Warsaw uprising (Polish revolt) which began on August 1, 1944 and lasted for two months. During and after the rebellion, the Germans razed the entire city of Warsaw.
