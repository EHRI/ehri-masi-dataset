423 Files

The Central Historical Committee (CHC) distributed questionnaires among the children (those from Hungary, and the rest from Poland) in DP camps, in order to collect information regarding the fate of the children and the fate of their families during the Nazi period.

The questionnaires include questions concerning the names of family members, their places of origin and the general background of the children. On the reverse side of each questionnaire there is a short report regarding the history of the child from the day s/he was deported to the ghetto, the camps to which s/he was deported, when s/he was separated from his/her family members and places where s/he was from after the liberation until his/her arrival at the DP camp.
