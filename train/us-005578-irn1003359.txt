German wounded

"The victory is achieved" announces the narrator, as a wounded German soldier is loaded onto a truck to receive medical care. He is given a cigarette to smoke and a pat on the head as he lies on the table, waiting for treatment. More wounded on stretchers transported from ambulances in the field to trains that will take them home. They smile out of the train window and sit up in their beds inside the train. Heroic music plays.
