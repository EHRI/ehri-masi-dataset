Renée de Monbrison diary and Colette Cahen d'Anvers Moore memoir

folder

1

The collection consists of one memoir, a typed and bound copy of Renée de Monbrison's wartime diary, from Sept 1939 to August 1944, which also includes copies of letters, documents, clippings, and post-war writings. Renée de Monbrison (née Cahen d'Anvers), who lived in Southern France, was Jewish, though her husband, Hubert de Montbrison, a member of the Resistance, was a Protestant. As the family was well-off, Renée used her social networks to escape arrest and deportation. Also included is one memoir written by Colette Cahen d'Anvers Moore, entitled "Eight Years of a Life." She describes her memories of her activities in the French Resistance, her December 1941 arrest, her yearlong imprisonment in La Santé prison, her transfer to Fresnes prison in 1943, her July 1943 deportation to Drancy, forced labor in Paris, her escape from a bus, and the liberation of Paris by the American Army.
