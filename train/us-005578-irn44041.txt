Naum Roshal was born in 1926 in Kapcevičy, Belarus to Ruvin Aronowicz (b. 1903) and Bronya Naumova (b.1905) and had a younger brother and younger sister. His family was evacuated from Kapcevičy to the city of Ufa, Bashkir ASSR when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. He served in the Red Army from 1943 to 1945 and fought the German Army in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, and Germany, taking part in the battle for Berlin and the liberation of Prague in May 1945. He married his former neighbor from Kapcevičy, Mila Golubitsky, and his family immigrated to the United States.

The collection also includes a digital copy of Book 1 of Roshal’s memoirs along with digital copies of Book 2 and Book 3 describing Roshal’s experiences during the periods 1945-1959 and 1959-1999, including his immigration to the United States.
