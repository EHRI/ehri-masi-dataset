Provenance unknown

The mother organisation, Mifleget ha-Avodah ha-Ziyyonit, was the Socialist Zionist party formed in 1920 by the union of Palestine Workers' Party, Ha-Po'el ha-Za'ir, with a majority of the Ze'irei Zion groups in the Diaspora. The latter groups had been formed in Russia at the beginning of the 20th Century by young Zionists who espoused the views of Ha-Po'el ha-Za'ir and intended to join the party upon their settlement in Erez Israel. The programme of Ze'irei Zion, announced at its second congress in Petrograd, in 1917, postulated the necessity to establish a Jewish labour commonwealth in the land of Israel and redirect the Jewish masses in the Diaspora to productive occupations.<br><br>Hitahadut Olej Germania was founded at the beginning of 1932 with the objective of providing advice and support to would-be emigr√©s from Germany to Palestine. The character of the organisation changed with the huge increase of emigrants during the great 'Alijah' (c1933?) after which it became more involved with issues around settlement, and the economic and cultural life of the new immigrants (945/1). The author of 945/4 is Dr. Krolik who was according to 945/5, p.4, the secretary for work deployment and agricultural organisation.

These reports and papers document in part the activities of the Socialist Zionist organisation Hitahadut Olej Germania.
