Jan and Stanislawa Hermanowski, their son Wojciech , and his older brother Andrzej, lived at 32/44 Raszynska Street in Warsaw. Jan was a high official in the city government. After the German occupation of Poland, both boys continued their education. Wojciech was able to do so legally due to his age, and Andrzej studied in an underground high school. After the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944, Wojciech and his parents were deported to a slave labor camp in Wriezen, and later Wojciech was transferred to work at a dairy in nearby Eberswalde. Andrzej was imprisoned in Auschwitz, Neuengamme, Braunschweig and Bergen Belsen. The family was reunited at the end of the war and transferred to Sweden, where they were able to convalesce at a center for refugees.

The papers consist of documents and photographs relating to the Hermanowski family of Warsaw. Includes Wojciech Hermanowksi's documents referring to his education and slave labor; family photographs, including among them a photograph depicting Wojciech working in a dairy; documents relating to the family's post-war status as displaced persons; and Swedish passport for foreigners.
