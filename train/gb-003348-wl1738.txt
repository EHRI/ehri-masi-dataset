Friedrich Ullstein: family correspondence

1 folder

Augustus Rupert Patrick Anthony Ullstein (born 1947) and Bartholomew William Henry Ullstein (born 1948) are the sons of Frederick Charles Leopold Ullstein and Patricia Guinness. Frederick Ullstein was the son of Hermann Ullstein (1875-1943), the youngest of Leopold Ullstein's sons who continued the German publishing business after his death. Frederick came over to the UK in the 1930s to flee Jewish persecutions in Nazi Germany (see biographical history of WL1361 for more information). Leopold Ullstein (1826-1899) was a German Jewish publisher from FÃ¼rth, Bavaria. He moved to Berlin and founded or purchased several newspapers such as the Neue Berliner Tageblatt, Berliner Zeitung, Berliner Abend- and Morgenpost and Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung. He had 10 children from two marriages with Mathilde Berend and Elise Pintus. His five sons Hans, Louis, Franz, Rudolf and Hermann continued the business and founded the Ullstein Verlag in 1903. The Ullstein family lost control of their businesses when the Jewish companies were aryanised in 1934 forming Deutsche Verlag. In 1952 the business was returned to the heirs of the family who sold it to the Axel Springer Verlag in 1960.
