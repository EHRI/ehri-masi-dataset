Guta Rozen was executed with hospital patients in the fall 1944 and her husband Gecel died during the death march from Buchenwald in April 1945; Czestochowa, Poland; circa 1935.

Consists of a registration certificate; issued in Czestochowa, Poland, on 14 January 1944, attesting to the fact that Eugenia Koziarska (in reality Sara Rozen; now: Chana Batista) was a Catholic and resided with Henryk and Gertruda Zielonka and a copy photograph bearing the image of Gecel Rozyn (or Rozen), the donorâ€™s father, who was murdered in the Buchenwald, Germany, concentration camp in 1945.
