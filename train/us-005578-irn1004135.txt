Propaganda film about the improved life of the German people under Hitler

Well-known scenes of interwar unrest, including street riots and communist rallies, interspersed with caberet performers and people in nightclubs. Shot of a bearded Jew walking down the street in Berlin. A brief shot of Hitler speaking is followed by Otto Braun, Prime Minister of Prussia, speaking against National Socialism in March, 1932. He speaks of a secret Nazi document that details plans to seize goods from farmers; those who resist will be shot (uncertain translation). The next scenes show Hitler among joyous crowds at a rally of some kind (presumably of farmers) and a brief shot of Hitler giving a speech.
