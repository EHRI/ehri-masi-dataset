Álorvosi iratok, 1964-1975

Nazi Germans conducted a series of medical experiments on large numbers of prisoners, mainly Jews from across Europe, but also on Romani people, ethnic Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and disabled non-Jewish Germans. These human experiments took place in concentration camps mainly in the early 1940s. Prisoners were coerced into these experiments that would often result in their death, or disfigurement or permanent disability of their bodies. Many deported Hungarian Jews fell victims to these infamous Nazi human experiments that were conducted, most notoriously, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp complex. This collection is based on documents that were created in the postwar period as a result of the introduction of so called compensation measures. The collection includes documentation of legal claims made by Hungarian Jewish victims of these Nazi pseudo-scientific experiments, their medical documentation, and their administrative records. The collection contains reproductions of alphabetized indexes to Bundesrückerstattungsgesetz-BRüG (Federal Restitution Act) and Bundesentschädigungsgesetz-BEG (German Federal Compensation Law) cases.
