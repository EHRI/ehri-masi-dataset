Consists of records concerning Jewish civilians in government jobs at the French Ministry of Defense. The decree of the 2nd Statute, June 2, 1941 (a replacement of the Decree, October 3, 1940) defined who was to be considered a member of the "Jewish race" elaborating rules concerning grandparents. The Article 4 of this decree listed the professions and positions that Jews could not exercise (positions in ministries). Exceptions were made when an individual could prove that he and/or his family had provided exceptional service to the French nation. This law applied to all of French territory, occupied as well as unoccupied zones, and overseas dominions and protectorates, unless the administrative office could no longer function without the personnel currently in place. The collection includes name lists and requests by individuals for exceptions to be made in the application of the decree. Accretion of 26 photographs from 2P 123 was added in Nov. 2019.
