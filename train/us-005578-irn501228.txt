Dr. Sidney Etkin (1910-1998) was a medical doctor during World War II. In June of 1945, Captain Etkin was assigned to treat prisoners of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, immediately after it was liberated by the Third United States Army.

The Sidney Etkin collection contains documents obtained by Etkin during his time treating prisoners from the recently liberated Mauthausen-Gusen camp in June, 1945. The documents contain statements made by Franz Zeireis, the commandant of the camp. He details the camp conditions, specific torture done to prisoners, numbers of prisoners killed, and other facts regarding the management of the concentration camp. Also included are photographs of the prisoners and camp, taken by Etkin, as well as a newspaper clipping summarizing the role Zeireis played in the management of Mauthausen.
