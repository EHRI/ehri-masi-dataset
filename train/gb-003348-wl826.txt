Rudolf Beck: family papers

3 folders

The father, Rudolf, owned a removals business in Vienna. His contacts enabled him to ship many of his possessions to the USA (see 826/2 for correspondence between his company and Enrico Kobau's removal company, Trieste).<br />There is no succinct history of the Beck family nor is it possible to establish from the documents themselves the background and fate of all the family members.<br />

This collection of papers of an Austrian Jewish family, who emigrated to England and the USA before the war, documents, in part, the activities of the family prior to emigration; life in the UK; and post war attempts to claim property in Austria.
