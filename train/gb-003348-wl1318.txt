1 folder

The papers were deposited by a one-time visitor to the Wiener Library, Herbert Engel, a member of a group of teachers, who promised that he would send some copies from his own personal archive.

The subject of the two letters at 13/18/1-2 was the paternal aunt of the depositor's wife. The author of the account at 1318/3 was the depositor's great uncle. During the period of the latter (April 1945) the depositor (then 6) was staying with his mother and 2 year old sister with relatives in the Harz mountains, having been evacuated from their home in KÃ¶ln.<br><br>All of the material is in German.

These copy documents provide a rare insight into the effects of Nazism and its demise on the German population.
