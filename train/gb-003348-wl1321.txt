1 folder

The depositor was the granddaughter of Feodor Schweitzer, the subject of some of the documents. The family came to Great Britain in 1938/ 1939. The relationship of the individuals referred to in the earlier documentation to the depositor is unknown. It appears that one of the depositor's ancestors was a court photographer in Berlin in the 1860s. The depositor died in 2000.

This miscellaneous collection of family papers documents the activities of a German Jewish family. It includes material on the aryanisation of the family business and the receipt of the <em> Kriegsverdienstkreuz f√ºr Kriegshilfe</em>, for service during the First World War. Some of the material is original.
