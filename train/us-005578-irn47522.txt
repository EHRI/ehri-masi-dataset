Żydowski Instytut Historyczny im. Emanuela Ringelbluma

Contains various photographs of the size of membership cards or passports, made in the early post-war years. They were attached to various documents (mainly from the records of the Organization for Rehabilitation and Training ( World ORT Union; ORT), the Towarzystwo Ochrony Zdrowia Ludności Żydowskiej (Society for Health-Protection of the Jewish Population in Poland; TOZ), and Centralny Komitet Żydów Polskich (Central Committe of the Jews in Poland; CKŻP): Department of Emigration, personal files), however, over several dozen years they were, due to unknown circumstances, separated from those documents. Therefore the identification of people on the photographs is sometimes impossible. Part of the photographs contain the name and surname on the reverse side.
