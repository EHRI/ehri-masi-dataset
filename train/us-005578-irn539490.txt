Erich Junker (1935-2012) was born in Aschaffenburg, Germany, the son of Fred (1920-1980) and Betty (nee Keller, 1905-2005) Junker, and was the second of three children. In 1936, Fred Junker left Germany for the United States, settling in Philadelphia, where he hoped to find work and once established, bring the rest of his family. The following year, Betty and her two sons, Herbert (born 1933) and Erich, were able to immigrate, along with Betty's mother, Martha Keller, as they had been sponsored by the Rosenau family in Philadelphia. Fred was employed by the firm of Rosenau Brothers, which produced children's clothing, and the family settled in a neighborhood in North Philadelphia that was home to many other German-Jewish emigre families. Following their immigration, Fred and Betty had a third child, Lillian, who was born in Philadelphia. Erich later changed the spelling of his first name to "Eric." He married Florine Jaffee, and they had several children. Eric Junker died in Philadelphia two days after his 77th birthday on 3 October 2012.
