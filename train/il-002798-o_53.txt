The Ludwigsburg Collection: Documentation regarding Nazi war crimes, collected by the West Germany legal system

176 Files

The collection contains documentation received mainly from the Zentrale Stelle de Landesjustizverwaltungen (Central Office of the State Judicial Administration) in Ludwigsburg, the body that assembled the material for the Nazi War Criminal Trials in West Germany. The documentation concentrates mainly on areas of the Soviet Union and Poland and to a degree on Czechoslovakia.

The collection contains important information regarding many Nazi war crimes reported by the groups that actually carried them out, mainly SS units, the police and the gendarmerie. Additionally, the collection includes both documentation and testimonies gathered by local judicial systems in the eastern European countries. There are also many reports of German units from the field providing information regarding murders of Jews that they carried out, dates, places where the murders took place and the number of Jews murdered. The collection also contains recommendations for the awarding of citations to SS personnel giving details of their actions, their personal files and more.
