By the Dar Pomorza Yacht to Stockholm

Sailors on board ship, hoisting sails, very busy. The Dar Pomorza at sea. Life on board, including exercise and interacting with the ship's mascot, which looks to be a lemur or similar animal. Ship at anchor, sailors in dress uniforms stand at attention. Civilians on board inspecting the ship.
