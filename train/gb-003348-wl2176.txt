John Wallington&nbsp;preserved Harry's archive, which was donated to the Library by John's daughter and nephew.&nbsp;

<p>Harry Ralton was born Karl-Heinz Rosenthal on 2 May 1907 in Breslau (Wrocław) to Salo, a wholesale merchant, and Margot. After showing considerable musical ability as a child, he pursued a career in music, first in Silesia, then from 1931 in Berlin. Two years later he took on the professional name Harry Ralton. Some of the most prominent figures of interwar light music performed his songs, including Richard Tauber. </p><p>The Nazis' rise to power limited Harry’s ability to work in Germany. He was imprisoned in Buchenwald and thereafter sought to escape to Britain with his mother. He arrived&nbsp;in Harlow on 28 August 1939, but his mother was prevented from leaving. Despite his efforts to help her flee, she was murdered in the Holocaust. </p><p>Harry first settled at the Money Hill Hotel in Rickmansworth, where he met John Wallington (or Wally), a skilled pianist. They became friends and musical collaborators. Harry also met here May Reeve, 40 years his senior, who became Harry’s benefactor. Another important supporter of Harry’s was Alfred Kalmus, to whom Harry claimed to be related. Kalmus was an Austrian well acquainted with the Viennese music scene. He took Harry in to his house in Wembley after Harry was forced to leave Rickmansworth, which was a high security area. </p><p> Harry continued writing music in the UK. In 1942 he was commissioned to produce a march (“All for Norway”) to celebrate King Haakon’s 70th birthday. In 1946 Harry set up the Arcadia Music Publishing Company with the conductor, singer and composer George Melachrino. </p><p> Harry died on 3 April 1953. Wally was responsible for taking care of his affairs, which were in some disarray. Kalmus and Wally each received half of Arcadia Music Publishing Co.</p>

<p>The archive contains the personal and business papers of Harry Ralton. The latter concern Harry’s firm the Arcadia Music Publishing Co. There is also an extensive collection of his sheet music published in interwar Germany and in the UK in the 1940s and 1950s. </p><p> In addition there are two folders of letters addressing Harry’s attempts to help his mother escape Germany, Harry's life and career in the UK, post-war conditions and the fates of friends under the Nazis. Prominent correspondents include Herbert Sandberg, Harry’s cousin and conductor of the Royal Swedish Opera, and the journalist and resistance organiser Ruth Andreas-Friedich, who was recognised by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. </p><p> Of note is also a piece of hate mail Harry received (see 2176/4/6) in response to the public announcement of his naturalisation.</p>
