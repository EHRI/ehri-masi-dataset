Robert Wieland: copy papers re compensation

1 folder

Robert Wieland and his brother were born in the 1940s in Berlin and had to live in exile in a French orphanage whilst their parents were in hiding on account of being Jewish and active opponents of the Nazi regime. After the war the family returned to Germany, to Mannheim. In the 1950s the parents separated and the children stayed at first with the mother then later to the grandmother in the DDR, where they spent the rest of their youth. Robert Wieland then went to Berlin to stay with his father. He later became a translator and worked for protracted periods in Cuba and Angola. Since his mid 20s he claims he suffered from depression. He argues that this was a direct consequence of the separation from the parents that he and his brother endured in their formative years.

This collection of copy papers documents a claim made by Robert Wieland on behalf of himself and his brother, Edgar Andree, for compensation from the German government for suffering caused by the Nazi regime. The papers include copy correspondence, psychiatric reports, affidavits etc
