Following Second World War trials with Nazi criminals and their collaborators were organized on the territory of restored Czechoslovakia just like in many other European countries of those days. The three-tier retributive justice system was established in the Slovak part of post-war Czechoslovakia by the Regulation of the Slovak National Council no. 33/1945 on the Punishment of Fascist Criminals, Occupants, Traitors, and Collaborators and on the Establishment of People’s Judiciary. National Court in Bratislava, District People’s Courts (Okresný ľudový súd) and Local People´s Courts represented the system of the retributive judiciary in Slovakia in 1945 - 1947. These courts ceased to function by 31 December 1947. Unfinished cases were subsequently transferred to the jurisdiction of special senates of County courts. However, after the Communist coup in 1948 a new law was adopted on 25 March 1948 which renewed the decree on retributive justice in the whole Czechoslovak republic and new People´s Courts were established.

The fonds contains files of People´s Court in Levoča,  which existed in 1948 as the retributive court. It contains several Holocaust-related files. Among others, it contains files with the information and testimonies on the hiding of Jews in Spišské Podhradie in 1942, the deportation of Jews from Spišské Podhradie, Stará Ľubovňa, Kežmarok in 1942. There is a file about the denunciation of a Jewish man by the aryaniser of his business in Spišské Podhradie and several files on various forms of persecution of Jews in Spišská Stará Ves, Spišská Belá etc. Besides that, the fonds contains the case-file of the former member of SS who served as a guard in Auschwitz.
