Contains a letter, dated August 17, 1941, written by Shmul Munia Taborinsky (Anna Mednikâ€™s great grandfather) who in June 1941, after the German invasion of the USSR, volunteered to serve in the Soviet Army at the age of 57. In his letter he described his duties in the transport company and expressed his deep feelings of love for his wife Berta and children: Ida, Sonia and Lisa, all residing in Leningrad. The collection also contains a photograph of Ida (born May 29, 1929 ) and Sofiya Taborinsky (Anna Mednik's grandmother and great aunt), taken in early June 1941 in Leningrad, a few months before the siege of that city. Shmul Taborinsky (1884-1941) was killed in action on August 21, 1941. His two younger daughters: Sonia and Lisa died of hunger during the siege of Leningrad in 1942.
