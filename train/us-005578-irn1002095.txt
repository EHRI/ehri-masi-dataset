Displaced Persons, Norwegian relief efforts

Notes taken from NCJF documentation, cribbed from narration presented by Cedric Hardwicke: "This film describes the life of the "hard core" displaced persons in a village in South Germany. They were the handicapped, the old, and the victims of polio that no country wanted. For them no jobs were made available and their lives seemed hopeless until the Norwegian government allowed small numbers to immigrate and settle. The rest of the film shows two people: one woman whose husband and two children had TB but were rehabilitated and were able to return to normal family life, and a blind man who worked as a physical therapist with polio victims." The film ends with Hardwicke saying: "Unless they get a chance, this is how they will spend their lives and this is how their children will grow up. Why? Because ten years ago or more they were herded into cattle trucks and taken to concentration camps. Now they are to receive the ultimate insult of being told that they are useless and are not wanted? Or are they to be given a chance for a new life?"
