Friedrich and Hertha Lewinski: personal papers

1 box

Friedrich ‘Fritz’ Lewinski (born 1889 in Wormditt, East Prussia, now Orneta, Poland) served as a physician in the German army during World War One. In 1916 he got married to Hertha Lewinski (born 1893), daughter of Fanny neé Loewenstein and Max Zacharias. He worked as a GP in Tilsit (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia) and was an active member of the local Jewish sports group 'Schild' ('<em>Sportbund des Reichsbundes jüdischer Frontsoldaten e.V.</em>'). According to the documents the couple and their son Gerhard began preparing for emigration in 1938 and must have emigrated shortly afterwards.

This collection contains the personal papers of Jewish couple Hertha neé Zacharias and Friedrich Lewinski from East Prussia who emigrated to the UK in the late 1930s. The rather fragmented documents focus on the time before their emigration and provide insights into Friedrich’s medical training and military service, his sports activities, certain insurance matters, and the couple’s wedding. Also contained are photographs of the main protagonists and numerous of their relatives and friends.
