Fradla Goldberg collection

folder

1

Consists of seven photographs, one copy of baptismal certificate, one other document. At age 18, “Jadwiga Kuzio” [left] learned that she was rescued as an infant after the 1942 liquidation of the Brest-Litovsk ghetto. She had been discovered wounded in an apartment owned by a family named Goldberg. Knowing only Jadwiga’s true last name and the apartment’s address, in January 2002, her daughter contacted the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, where registration forms for the Goldberg family identified the daughter born in 1941 to have been named Fradla [that the USHMM had microfilmed from the Brest-Litovsk Archives]. Through the USHMM, Fradla/Jadwiga learned the names, birthdates and professions of her parents, that she had an older sibling and she, for the first time, saw photographs of both of them through our efforts. The 1941 registration forms, which the German authorities ordered Jews in Brest-Litovsk, Poland, to complete, provided a key clue to unraveling Jadwiga Kuzio’s true identity. Of the Goldbergs listed, only one, Lejba (below), recorded the birth of a girl in 1941. The baby’s name was Fradla.
