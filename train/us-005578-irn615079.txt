The Bikur Cholim society of Graz was funded in 1921. Despite its name, it aided not only the sick, but also poor and needy, including Jewish refugees finding themselves in Graz during the WWI. The society conducted a yearly the “Kinder auf Land” (Children to the Country) campaign, which allowed children from the poor Jewish families to spend vacations at summer camp. The organization ceased activities after the Nazi Anschluss of Austria on March 1938. .

This collection contains office records of the Bikur Cholim: regulations, correspondence, appeals to the Jews of Graz for membership, name lists of members and donors, records of aid to children, and financial accounts. Also included are copies of newspapers “Die Stimme Der Jude” for 1937, and personal papers of the society director E. Grunschlag: personal correspondence with his wife and son. Note: USHMM Archives holds only selected records.
