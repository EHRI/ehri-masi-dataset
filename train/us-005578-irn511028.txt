Paul Schneiderman (1919-2013) was born Pinchas Sznayderman in October 1919 in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland to Chaya and Noah Sznayderman. He had at least three siblings: Israel, Moishe, and Motel. Paul was the survivor of several camps including Buchenwald and Dachau. After the war he met his wife Judith Rosenberg in the Landsberg displaced persons camp. They immigrated to the United States in 1947 and settled in New Jersey.

Judith Schneiderman (1928-2018) was born Judith Rosenberg on 22 August 1928 in Rachov, Czechoslovakia (Rakhiv, Ukraine) to Yankel and Yetta Rosenberg. She had seven siblings: Suri, Ruchel, Malcha, Frieda, Esther, Chochu, and Abraham. Her family owned a store in Rachov that was confiscated in 1938 by the Hungarian government. Judith was a survivor of Auschwitz and met her husband Paul Schneiderman in the Landsberg displaced persons camp. They immigrated to the United States in 1947 and settled in New Jersey.

The collection consists of photographs documenting the Holocaust-era experiences of the Schneiderman family, including pre-war depictions of Paul Schneiderman's family in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, post-war life in the Landsberg displaced persons camp, and aboard the SS Ernie Pyle enroute to the United States in 1947.
