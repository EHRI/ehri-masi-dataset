Di hoyfzinger | Di Wanderer

Radio Leon / Yiddish recordings published in Buenos Aires in 1950. Side A = Di hoyfzinger. Music and text: unknown (repertoire probably from "Ararat" theater, prewar Lodz). Side B = Di Wanderer (Di vandere; AKA Tango fun geto). Music: Sholom Secunda (parody of "Mayn yidishe maydele"); Words: Unknown. Performers: Elvira Bochcovska, Shimon Nussbaum, Max Neufeld, instrumental ensemble. The Bochcovska/Nussbaum/Neufeld revue "'Di freylekhe vanderer" oder 'Nisht dos vos geven'" (the happy wanderers or not what it used to be) toured Latin America in the 1950s, and may have recorded under the group name "Di vandere." Nussbaum and Neufeld were veterans of the prewar "Ararat" kleinkunst theater in Lodz; Bochcovska had studied dance in Moscow. Bochcovska and Neufeld recorded some of the same repertoire in postwar Paris. In the Paris sessions, the artists were accompanied by the Orchestra Ben-Horris (refer to https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn702463 for photos and artifacts from the Ben Horris (Moscovitz) family.
