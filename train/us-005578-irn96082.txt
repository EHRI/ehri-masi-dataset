Correspondence of Jewish families during the German occupation of the Netherlands and their deportation. This collection includes (copies of) letters that relatives and acquaintances wrote to each other, often supplemented with photographs, identification cards, diaries and other personal documents. The emphasis is on the period of the occupation, but some files of correspondence dates from the 1930s through the late 1940s
