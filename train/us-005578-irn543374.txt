Also included are two documents in French relating to Joseph Rosen: the first one recognizes him as former concentration camp internee, originally from Czechoslovakia but who had survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald; the second is a certificate of repatriation stating that he was originally from Munkacs, and that his parents were Maurice and Therese (nee Bercovici) Rosen.
