Tetyana Kotlyarska (born Tatiana Zilberwort) was born on February 17, 1925 in Kiev, Soviet Union (now Ukraine) to Berko and Sonia Zilberwort. Her brother, Meir Milia Zilberwort, was killed in action as a soldier in the Soviet Army in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1941. Tatiana, her parents, and her maternal grandparents, Aron and Mirl Niepomniashiyi, were evacuated to Bukhara (now Bukhoro) in Uzbekistan in June 1941. Tatiana attended a teacher's seminary while she was in Bukhara. After World War II, the Zilberwort family returned to Kiev, and Tatiana married her school friend, Grisha Kotlyarski. She joined him in Berlin, Germany, where he was stationed, and their son, Michael, was born in 1948. Their daughter, Irina, was born later in Kiev.

The papers consist of eight photographs of Tetyana Kotlyarska and her family in the Soviet Union and Germany before, during, and after World War II and one school notebook used by Tetyana Kotlyarska at the Teacher's Pedagogical Institute in Bukhara (Bukhoro), Uzbekistan.
