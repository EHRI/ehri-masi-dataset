Siegfried Strauss (later Fred Strauss, 1898-1956) was born in Marburg, Germany to Hermann (1856-1934) and Johanna (née Wertheim, 1859-1942) Strauss. He had three brothers, Bruno (b. 1887), Ernst (b.1889), and Julius (b. 1890). Siegfried served in World War I and operated a leather importer and exporter business in Frankfurt, Germany that was likely started by his grandfather Koppel Strauss (1831-1917). He married Marguerite Wolff (1902-1944) and had two children, Marion Carola (later Marion Sapir, b. 1926) and Karl Heinz (1929-1945). Due to increasing Nazi persecution, Siegfried moved his family to Amsterdam, the Netherlands by 1938. His brother Ernst and his wife Hedwig (later Hedy Strauss, neé Liebenberg) immigrated to the United States and Bruno moved to England around the same time. In August 1942 the family was arrested and sent to the Westerbork concentration camp. In April 1943 they were deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp. In early 1944 Siegfried was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. He was then sent as a metalworker to a weapons factory in the Gleiwitz subcamp. In January 1945 Siegfried was sent to the Blechhammer subcamp and was liberated by the Red Army on January 22. Several months after Siegfried was sent to Auschwitz, Karl was selected to go there. Marguerite and Marion worked in factory and were exempt, but decided to accompany him. Upon arrival, Marguerite was separated from her children and was sent to the gas chamber. Marion was sent to the Oederan sub camp of the Flossenburg concentration camp, where she worked construction of a weapons factory. In April 1945, she, along with other prisoners was sent on a forced-march to Theresienstadt where they were liberated by the Red Army on May 9. Her brother Karl survived the war, but perished shortly after being liberated. Marion reunited with her father in Amsterdam, and they immigrated to the United States in 1947 with help from Siegfried’s brother Ernst. They settled in Chicago, Illinois where Siegfried worked with his brother at a leather company. Marion became a physical therapist. She married Albert Sapir (born Avram Sapir, d. 2005) in 1950, and they had six children.
