Stanisław Rogulski was born Hersz Roza in 1909 in Pułtusk, Poland to Abram (Adam) and Tauba (Teofila) Roza (although later documents list his birth as 1910 in Pinsk). He married Apolonia Molenda (b. 1914) in 1946, changed his name to Stanisław Rogulski in 1947, and their daughter Barbara (Basia) was born in Paris 1948. He taught history and French in Warsaw and L’viv before World War II, survived the Holocaust teaching in Yerevan, Armenia, and taught history and philosophy in Warsaw after the war. He also served as a diplomat from 1945-1950 and 1956-1968, was dismissed during the anti-Semitic repression of the Polish 1968 political crisis, and relocated with his wife to France and then Sweden.

The Stanisław Rogulski papers consist of biographical materials, correspondence, and photographs documenting Rogulski’s academic and diplomatic career until his dismissal during the antisemitic repression of the Polish 1968 political crisis. The collection also includes a handful of records documenting his stepmother Helena Molenda’s survival in hiding during the Holocaust.
