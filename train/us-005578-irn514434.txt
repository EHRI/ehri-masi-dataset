“War and Resistance: This I Remember,” a memoir details Anne Levine’s Holocaust experiences. Levine spent 1940-1942 at the “Rayon de Soleil” children’s home in Cannes, France. In 1942, she went into hiding in the Durfort home of Denise and Paul Cadier. When this became too dangerous, she went to Paris and, under an assumed name, got a job as a research assistant at the "Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique." Along with many of the employees at the center, notably Dr. Jacques Monod, she joined the Resistance and remained in Paris until the city's liberation in 1944.
