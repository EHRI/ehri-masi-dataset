Abram Bork (1923-2012) was born on 1923 January 17 in Zamość, Poland to Jankiel (b. 1894 in Krasnobród) and Ruchel (née Bernstein, b. 1896). Ruchel was the daughter of Moshe and Chaya Bernstein, and was born in Szczebrzeszyn. Her parents immigrated to the United States before the war. Abram had at least three siblings: Rozia (b. 1920), Chaim (b. 1929), and Salomon (b. 1927). His family lived in Lublin, Poland. Abram immigrated to the United States in early 1939, arriving in New York on 1939 April 6 aboard the MS Batory. He was sponsored by his maternal uncle Benjamin Bernstein, and lived with his maternal grandparents in Brooklyn. He worked in his uncle’s dry goods store and took high school classes in the evening. He joined the United States Army in February 1943. Abram was wounded in January 1945 and sent home. He married Evelyn Stockman in February 1945. They had two children: Rachel (Rachel Dunaief) and Jerome. Abram communicated with his family in Lublin, and he sent them care packages. His last letters received from them were in 1941. He learned after the war that his uncle Mojsze Bork, and cousins Ichak Bork and Rachela Helfman all survived. The fate of his immediate family remains unknown.

The collection documents the Holocaust-era experiences of Abram Bork, originally of Lublin, Poland, who immigrated to the United States in April 1939. Biographical papers include his Polish passport, a report card, immigrant identification card, and two receipts regarding care packages he sent his family in Lublin in 1941. Correspondence consists of wartime letters and postcards to Abram from his parents Jankiel and Ruchla, his sister Rozia, and his brothers Salomon and Chaim. Post-war correspondence consists of letters and postcards primarily from his uncle Mojsze Bork, and cousins Ichak Bork and Rachela Helfman. There are also English translations of some letters. Photographs include wartime depictions of Abram’s family, with someone holding a photograph of Abram; Abram in front of the MS Batory in 1939; and Abram with his fiance Evelyn Stockman on their wedding day, 1945; and Abram with a couple who is likely his grandparents. The last two photographs depict Abram in his United States Army uniform.
