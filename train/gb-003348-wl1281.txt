The Internationale Auschwitz Komitee: Copy correspondence and papers

1 folder

Whilst the provenance of this collection of copy correspondence of the <i> Internationale Auschwitz Komitee</i> is unknown, it is probable that it came from Hermann Langbein, former secretary of that organization

The <i> Internationale Auschwitz Komitee</i> was founded in 1952 by former inmates of the death camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, with the following aims: to bear witness to the crimes of the Nazis in the camp; to fight for compensation for former inmates and their families; to work with the Auschwitz Museum to preserve the site of the camp as a permanent memorial.<br/><br/>The <i> IAK</i> became involved in the gathering of statements and testimony against former camp guards and other Nazi personnel. Many of the witnesses who provided testimony later took part in the â€˜Frankfurt Trial' of perpetrators at Auschwitz.<br/><br/>These papers consist of statements [of no longer than 1 page] from former inmates at Auschwitz and correspondence between the <i>IAK</i> and other organizations regarding the prosecution of perpetrators at Auschwitz.
