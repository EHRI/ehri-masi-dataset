6 pages of the paper copies (printed and handwritten).

The list was compiled by survivor David Jeršanski’s daughter-in-law Rina Jeršansky-Dubrovič (her father was from Kaunas); it includes surnames of 49 Jewish families (149 persons). These people were from the small towns of Perloja and Nedzingė. The list was given to the Holocaust Exhibition on 6 June 2001 by Rina Jeršansky-Dubrovič.
