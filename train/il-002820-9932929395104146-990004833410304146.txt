The Position of the Jews in Germany (May)

1 electronic resource (27 pages)

The file contains a report from May 1936 about the position of the Jews in Germany written in English and German. The Jewish Central information Office published every month a new report, regarding the situation of Jews in Germany. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). The main point was to reach as many people from all over the world as possible, to inform about the situation of Jews in Germany and their persecution through the Nazi regime. The monthly reports were available in several languages. This report is divided into anecdotal report one and two, which is the first time the publisher divided the reports like that and not in several chapters. Only the anecdotal report one is divided into 4 subchapters. "The fight of the Jews in German economy", "New obsticals for Jewish children andadults in swimmingpools" "The anti-semetic boycott 1935 and its consequences' and 'German ghettos 1936".
