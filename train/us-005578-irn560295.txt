Collection consists of several examples of the fund raising and public relations pieces that were sent by the Committee to not only garner support for displaced persons who remained in camps in Europe awaiting emigration, but to raise funds under the signature of Earl G. Harrison and William S. Bernard (secretary of the committee).
