The American Jewish Congress (AJC) was first convened in 1918 as an organization of American Jewish leaders pursuing equal rights for Americans. In 1936, the AJC helped establish the World Jewish Congress (WJC) and acted as a liaison between the WJC and the American government on issues related to emergency relief for Jewish refugees. After World War II, the WJC assisted the rebuilding of European Jewish communities, and the AJC aided these efforts by providing support for Holocaust survivors, displaced persons, and other victims of the war.
