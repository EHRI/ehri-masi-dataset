American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee

The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) is the worldâ€™s leading Jewish humanitarian assistance organization. The JDC was founded in 1914 to assist Jewish persons in Palestine during World War I. The Holocaust and World War II caused the JDC to ramp up its relief efforts. With the end of the war in 1945, Jewish survivors were placed into hastily created displaced persons camps throughout Europe. Along with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the JDC helped administer these camps and provide supplies. The JDC has aided millions of Jews in more than 85 countries.

Contains records of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (AJJDC) offices in Geneva, Stockholm and Istanbul and odd files of the offices in Lisbon, Brussels and Barcelona. Most of the records consist of correspondence of various JDC offices with other international Jewish and non-Jewish organizations, and with local Jewish communities and organizations, concerning post-war rehabilitation of Holocaust survivors, emigration from Europe, restitution and heirless property. Also includes a large number of name lists of Holocaust survivors and emigrants.
