Consists of one memoir, two copies (in English and Spanish), of "Non Omnis Moriar," by Irene Birnbaum, originally of Warsaw, Poland. In her memoir, she describes her life in the Warsaw ghetto, including her memories of the deportations of friends and loved ones, and how she resisted deportation while living in the ghetto. She escaped the Warsaw ghetto in February 1943, and hid, first in Warsaw and then as a Polish Catholic worker in the countryside.
