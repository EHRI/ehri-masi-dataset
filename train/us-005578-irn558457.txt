Rolf Henne (1901-1966) was a Swiss attorney and politician of the National Front (NF) and pro-Nazi movements. Henne was the son of a socially prominent physician from Schaffhausen and was related to the psychiatrist Carl Jung. He studied in Great Britain, at Zürich and Heidelberg Universities, completing his academic degree in law and then briefly practicing law. As the Landesführer he headed the newly formed National Front (NF) from 1934. But because of his known Nazi ties, subsidies he received from Berlin, and his support of the Nazi movement, Rolf Henne was forced to resign from the NF, and left the party with two other extremists, Swiss journalist Hans Oehler (1888–1967), and Swiss novelist Jacob Schaffner (1875-1944). Although demoted, Henne remained the Gauführer for Schaffhausen. He supported a genuine form of Swiss National Socialism, and in 1938 was one of the founders of the Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschaung (BTE), a Swiss political party which belonged to the National Front movement. In 1940, Henne joined Max Leo Keller in the founding of the even more fascistic organization the Nationale Bewegung der Schweiz (NBS) [National Movement of Switzerland]. In 1944, he became the director of the press service Zeitungslupe in Zurich. He took no further role in politics after the war; instead, he headed up the Argus der Presse newsclipping agency. He died in Küsnacht in 1966.
