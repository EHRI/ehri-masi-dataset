Statements of death, with accompanying investigative documentation, issued by the Office of General Prosecutor in Kielce. Majority of records relate to Kielce Jews from the years of German occupation. Prosecutor's investigations cover the period from 1945 until 1951. Included are persecution of civilians, descriptions of the deaths of individuals and groups of people murdered by the occupier, deaths of Poles who perished in labor camps, concentration camps, and displacements, and the persecution of Jews. Most of investigations of the Attorney General (General Prosecutor) in Kielce relate to matters of the restoration of abandoned and post-German estates as per the decree of March 8, 1946 (Decree concerning abandoned and formerly German assets), as well as various non-disputable procedures in civil cases, e. g. presuming someone dead or finding someone dead.
