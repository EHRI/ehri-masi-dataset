Magyar Híradó 805. Intertitle reads “MEGKEZDODÖTT A MUNKASZOLGÁLAT. Az I. hadtesthez bevonult munkaszolgálato-sok eskiitéle a szentendrei táborban. M.F.I. ZSABKA-NAGY L.” accompanied with music. An officer in glasses reads from a paper at a podium with the Hungarian flag on the left. The Jewish forced labor service stands in neat rows in front of him, each man with his right hand up and fingers extended except for the pinky and ring finger. More of the officer as he reads from the paper. He reads aloud, and then men in front of him respond in unison. Two shovels stick up from the sides of a weapon. Soldiers stand with their arms at their sides. The men of the forced labor service continue to respond in unison to the man at the podium. Then they march. Officers raise their hands to their heads in salute. The soldiers have their weapons on their right shoulders.
