Dita Kürschner (b. 1930) was born to Lajos and Hedy Kürschner and they lived in Vienna, Austria. The family left Austria for Lajos Kürschner’s hometown, Nagykanizsa, Hungary, in March 1939. At the end of April 1944 the Jews of Nagykanizsa were forced into a ghetto and three weeks later they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. From June 1944 until September 1944 Dita and her mother, Hedy, were imprisoned in Gelsenberg concentration camp and later in Sommerda. Both survived the death march and immigrated to Israel. Dita’s father, Lajos, died in Buchenwald on January 2, 1945.

Collection consists of photographs depicting the Kürschner family in Vienna, Austria, 1932 to 1948, photographs depicting life in the Leipheim DP camp, meeting her future husband, Benjamin Segal, and his brother Jehuda from Satu-Mare, and later in Israel.
