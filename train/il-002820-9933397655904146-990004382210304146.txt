1 electronic resource (11 pages)

The first part of this file is a letter by Dr. Felix Boesler, Königsberg, Prussia, to Comrad Braune to inform the latter about Schmit's dismissal from the "Nationalsozialistischer Rechtswahrerbund" (NSRB; National Socialist Association of German Legal Professionals) and that he is supposed to get a new professorship in Leipzig and his post in Berlin is supposed to be taken over by Professor Ritterbusch. The second part of this file is a letter by the Security Service Superior District South to the Berlin based Main Office of the Security Service regarding Schmitt. It announces the attached results of their local investigation on him. As the material from Prof. [Otto] Koellreutter about Schmitt was passed on from the alliance of academics, as there is no direct connection to Koellreutter and it is not planned to install one. It points out an article about Schmitt published in the issue number one of January 8th, 1937, of the periodical "Mitteilungen zur weltanschaulichen Lage" (Information on the ideological situation) [by] "Der Beauftragte des Führers für die Überwachung der gesamten geistigen und weltanschaulichen Schulung und Erziehung der NSDAP" (Commissioner of the Führer for the observation of the entire intellectual and ideological education of the National Socialist German Worker's Party) [editor]. This article was not included in the current report about Schmitt, as it was published only very recently. It contains a thorough evaluation of Schmitt's writings. This introduction is followed by a summary of Schmitt's vita, his political opinion, some of his writings and most important scientific publications.
