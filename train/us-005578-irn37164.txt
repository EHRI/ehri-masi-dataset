Contains a letter of recommendation for Gerszon Markman (donor's husband) from the director of the Heidenheim DP camp; dated February 20, 1946. Gerszon Markman was secretary of the camp, and this letter was written to wish them well on their journey to Belgium. They were stopped at the Belgian border because they did not have the right papers, so they ended up travelling to the United States instead.
