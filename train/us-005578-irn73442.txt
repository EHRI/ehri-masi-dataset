Fundacja Polsko-Niemieckie Pojednanie

Foundation Polsko-Niemieckie Pojednanie (FPNP) was established on November 27, 1991 per initiative of the government of the Republic of Poland. The Foundation collected approximately one million applications submitted by individuals, who sought compensation for their forced labor for Third Reich during the German occupation of Poland. These applications usually quote detailed information about condition of work and indicate geographical locations, and also are supported by testimonies of witnesses, original photographs and documents.

The collection contains various records collected by the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation (FPNP) during the project related to the payment of indemnities to Polish citizens for their forced labor on the territories of the Third Reich. Records include questionnaires, accounts, memoirs, diaries, interviews, correspondence, press cuttings; some photographs or other related documents are attached to the forced laborers files.
