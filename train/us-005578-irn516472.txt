Eva Shmoys papers

Martin Jahoda was the proprietor of a family printing business in Vienna, Austria, which handled the works of Karl Kraus, the Austrian writer and literary critic who denounced National Socialism. When Martin was arrested on Kristallnacht and sent to Dachau concentration camp, his wife, Else, went to considerable lengths to find out where he was incarcerated and to plead for his release with Adolf Eichmann. Martin was eventually released and was given 24 hours to leave the country. He arranged transit to Sweden after several failed attempts to gain legal papers and was reunited there with his wife. A year later, they were granted visas to the United States where Martin established a new printing firm. Martin Jahoda died in July 1990, and Else Jahoda died in Jan. 1995.

The papers consist of two postcards sent between Martin Jahoda, a prisoner in Dachau concentration camp, and his wife, Elisabeth (Else) Jahoda in Vienna, Austria, in 1938 and two photographs of Martin and Else Jahoda in 1937.
