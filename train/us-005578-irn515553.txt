Ellen Gale is the wife of Manfred Gale (Gallewski). Manfred (also known as Manni) lived with his family in Trebnitz, Germany. After Hitler came to power, the family was persecuted culminating in the imprisonment of Richard Gallewski (Manfred's father) in Buchenwald. He was released after two weeks because he was a hero of World War I. The family; Richard (father), Kate (mother), Manfred, and Klaus, then left Germany. Because they had American relatives in Richmond, Virginia, they acquired passage on the ship Iberia, which traveled to Cuba. Unlike the fateful voyage of the St. Louis, which was the ship that left Europe shortly after, the Iberia, landed safely in Cuba. The family lived in Cuba, where Manfred spent part of the year as a worker on a Quaker international farm, before being allowed to enter the United States in December of 1940.

Contains 37 photographs depicting the Gallewski family and other refugees on board the ship "IBERIA," en route to Cuba in 1939, their daily life in Havana, Cuba, and on board a ship en route to Miami, Florida, in 1940.
