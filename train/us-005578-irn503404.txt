Troadec, Pierre

Cotains copies of two issues of "Hier Cauchemar Aujourd'hui Espoir: Bulletin interieur d'information et de liaison de l'Amicale des Deportes Politique de Mauthausen." The first issue, November 1945. - No. 3, contains a partial list of French deportees who perished at Mauthausen. The list is arranged in alphabetical order starting with ABADE, HENRI and ending with DENIS, ROGER. The second issue continues the alphabetical list with DENTROUX, JEAN and concludes with ZWEIBEL, ERICH. The main alphabetical list is followed by separate list of women's names. The date on the second issue is illegible, but presumably was published in February 1946. Also includes information about Gusen, a sub-camp of Mauthausen.
