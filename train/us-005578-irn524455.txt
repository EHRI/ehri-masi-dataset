These files derive from three sections of the Administration's Department of Social and Political Matters: Social and Political, Religious, and Productivity of the Jewish People in the Wrocław Province. They include reports on the Jewish population, Jewish institutions, and Jewish congregations, including conflicts within the Jewish community. Most of the files are from the Provincial Commissioner for the Productivity of the Jewish People in the Wrocław Province, whose objectives were to employ Jews in industry; establish, finance, and supply cooperatives and farms; find housing for Jews; take care of mothers, children, and people unable to work; maintain records; and promote closer Polish-Jewish relations.
