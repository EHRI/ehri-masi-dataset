He also states that he assisted Dorothy Buxton in the preparation of her book 'the Refugee and You'. At the request of Professor Leonard Woolf he prepared a memo on the subject of the International Advisory Committee of the Labour Party, which was widely circulated by Transport House. He was one of the Honorary Solicitors assisting the Jewish Refugees Committee and was in close contact with Norman Bentwich. In addition, according to the 1937/8 annual report of the Haldane Society, Duchin was a member of that organisation and chaired a sub-committee on the law relating to aliens for which he wrote a report (see -/3). After the war he became involved in the redistribution of property stolen by the nazis (-/6)</p>
