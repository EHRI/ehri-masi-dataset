Meir Zelig Holcman was born in Gombin (Gąbin), Poland, on May 14, 1914. He was the youngest of ten children of Eliahu Holcman and Rasza Zlotnik Holcman. In 1924, Eliahu, who was a fruit merchant and traveled throughout Poland, was severely beaten and died soon after. Rasza Holcman took over her husband’s business and, with the help of her sons, managed to support the family. There were six sons and four daughters in the Holcman household: Israel Boruch “Bucik,” who married Ester Manczyk; Josef, who married Lea Zolna; Hersz Lejzor (b. 1905), who married Sara Chaja Koren; Abraham Icchak (b.1895), who married Lea Luidor; Moshe Aaron, who married Mirl from Wyszogród, Poland; Meir Zelig; Golda Itta, who married Hersz Lajb Bauman; Fajga, who married Jehuda Luksenburg; Chana, who immigrated to Palestine in 1934; and Perla, who died in childhood. Meir was active from a very young age in the Zionist youth movement “Ha’shomer Ha’tzair,” and in July 1939, he and his longtime girlfriend and future wife, Rifka Gostynski, left Poland. The young couple traveled to Constanza, Romania, where they boarded the ship, Colorado. They settled in Kibbutz Evron in Palestine. All of Meir’s family members in Gombin, including his nieces and nephews, were murdered by the Germans in the Chelmno extermination camp in 1942. Meir Holcman died in 1998. His daughter, Ada Holtzman, established a memorial web site, “Zchor,” for Holocaust victims from Gombin, Poland, and the vicinity.

The collection consists of seven photographs documenting the Holcman family in Gąbin (Gombin), Poland, before and during the Holocaust, including depictions of forced labor in Gąbin.
