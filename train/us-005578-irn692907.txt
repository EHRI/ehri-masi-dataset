Lt. Colonel Harry E. Malcom was one of 4 sons born to Walter Younger and Sarah (Archibald) Malcolm from Indiana, Pennsylvania, who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during the Second World War. Malcolm served from 1942 to 1946 and saw action in the European Theater with the 12th Amored Division.

Consists of a handwritten eight-page draft letter by Lt. Colonel Harry E. Malcolm of the 12th Armored Division to Colonel Julien D. Saks in response to a March 1985 article in "Hellcat News." The letter concerns what Malcolm witnessed and experienced during the liberation of the Landsberg concentration camp in April 1945. Among other scenes, the letter describes Malcolm's discovery of 15-20 prisoners who had been killed by machine gun in the days prior to the liberation of the camp, an act he speculated was to silence potential witnesses to the crimes that had taken place there.
