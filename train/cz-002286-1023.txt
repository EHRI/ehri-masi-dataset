The Nuremberg trials were the series of military trials held for the prosecution of prominent Nazi leaders in Germany after the WWII. The first and most known trial of 24 “major war criminals” such as Martin Bormann, Hermann Göring or Rudolf Hess etc. was held before the International Military Tribunal from November 20, 1945 to October 1, 1946. This major trial was followed by 12 trials (known as subsequent Nuremberg trials) held before the U.S. Military Tribunals which tried Nazi leaders responsible for other economic, political and military matters of the Third Reich.
