United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of seven post-war photographs from the collection of Simon Ruder, originally of Obertyn, Poland. Mr. Ruder was deported to Loncki prison in 1941, where he spent two years sewing Nazi uniforms before being sent to Auschwitz, Dachau, and then the MÃ¼hldorf subcamp, from which he was liberated in 1945. The photographs, taken at an unknown displaced persons camp, depict Mr. Ruder, his brother Mendel, and other newly released prisoners. Includes a photograph of what appears to be a remembrance ceremony, and a group picture in which some of the men appear to be wearing prisoner uniforms.
