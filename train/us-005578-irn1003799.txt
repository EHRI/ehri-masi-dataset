Opening of Chopin Museum

Newsreel showing Ludmilla Berkwic, whose father's family was Jewish, playing the piano at the opening of the Chopin Museum in Wawel Castle. Hans Frank and other Nazi officials are in attendance. Berkwic is shown playing Chopin's piano. The piano music continues over interior shots of the museum and its artifacts. Berkwic's father was Jewish but she was living as a non-Jew when Hans Frank asked her to perform at the opening of the Chopin Museum in Krakow. Soon after her performance she was denounced as a Jew. She and her mother obtained false papers and fled to her fiancee's home in Germany. Ludmila worked as a forced laborer at a munitions factory until 1945 [this information is from Ludmilla Berkwic's website: http://www.ludmillaberkwic.org/].
