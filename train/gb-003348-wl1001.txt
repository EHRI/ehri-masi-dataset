1 file

Received from Hugo Valentin, one of the correspondents.

The following information on Valentin was taken from <em>Encyclopoedia Judaica</em>.<br><br>Hugo Maurice Valentin (1888-1963) was a historian and Zionist leader. Born in Sweden, Valentin first served as a teacher of history at a high school in Falun, but in 1930 was appointed lecturer and in 1948 professor at the University of Uppsala. Topics: European/ Prussian history and history of Jews in Sweden. In 1925 he became a Zionist, and from then on dedicated himself passionately to spreading Zionism to Swedish Jews. He became president and later honorary president of the Zionist Federation. He died suddenly preparing an argument against an anti-Zionist in a Stockholm radio station.

Collection of printed antisemitic material and associated correspondence. The central theme of the collection are the views of Judge N. W. Rogers, a virulent anti-semite, who believed in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the domination of the financial world by international Jewry. He sent one of his pamphlets and 2 others of a similar nature to Hugo Valentin in Sweden, with a letter in which he reasserts his antisemitic arguments. Evidently they had already corresponded although it is not clear why. In addition there is correspondence between the Jewish Central Information Office and Valentin.
