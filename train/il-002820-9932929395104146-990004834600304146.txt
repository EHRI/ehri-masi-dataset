1 electronic resource (108 pages)

The file contains several reports regarding the 'Jüdische Fragen in Gesetzgebung und Rechtsprechung des Dritten Reiches' (Jewish questions in legislation and jurisprudence of the Third Reich) from January till April 1938. The Jewish Central Information Office published several reports every month to inform the world about the position of Jews in Germany and other anti-Semitic countries. In this files reports inform about the planned anti-Semitic tendency of the legislation of the Third Reich which shifted more and more to the material realm, revealing the true background of the annihilation of Jews. For example new laws regarding the 'Sperrmark' were announced. The Sperrmark was introduced in 1931, so that financial assets that were to be transferred abroad had to be deposited in a "Sperrmark account". Through this system mostly Jews lost all their money when they wanted to emigrate to an other country, on the other hand the government made emigration for most people impossible from 1934, as the Dego levy was around 20 percent and rose up to 96 percent. Other declarations informed that from 1938 all Jews had to register their wealth, the author explains in detail what had to be done and what it ment for the Jewish population. All Jews living in 'Greater Germany', including occupied countries were forced to register everything which belonged to them. Also a report regarding the position of Jews in June 1938 is attached, giving general informations.
