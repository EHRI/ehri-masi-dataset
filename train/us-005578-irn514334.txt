This collection contains records of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. They describe conditions in Nazi-occupied territories of Ukraine; secret reports to Nikita Khrushchev, the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, about the political and economic situation in the areas liberated from Nazi occupation; activities of various groups of Ukrainian nationalists; and antisemitism. Documents also address repatriation of groups deported to Germany (Fond 1). From the Special Commission for the history of the Great Patriotic War, a body established by the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences, are records related to partisan activities in the Ukraine; copies and originals of German-captured documents, wartime diaries, and reports on the fate of Soviet POWs in Nazi camps (Fond 166). Posters from the period of the Great Patriotic War derive from Fond 56, and records of the Ukrainian staff of the division named in honor of General Sidor Kovpak come from Fond 62.
