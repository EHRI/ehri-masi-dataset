Jakub Rabinowicz (b. 1906), a watchmaker, and Feiga Zipora Deutsch Rabinowicz lived at 3 Maja Street. They had two daughters: Shoshana (b. May 22, 1936) and Rivka (b. October 1938). Jakub’s parents and two siblings immigrated to Tel Aviv, Palestine in 1935. In September 1939, shortly before the Germans arrived in Gorlice, Jakub noticed that the mayor of town was packing. He packed his family and possessions and left for Lwów. Within six months Soviets deported them to a labor camp near Novosibirsk. In early 1942, they were released and moved to Kuybyshev near Novosibirsk, where Jakub repaired watches and typewriters. In the summer of 1943 the Rabinowicz family moved to Jambul (today Taraz) in Kazakhstan, where Jakub opened a store. After failed efforts to leave the Soviet Union, the family returned to Poland in 1945 and settled in Wroclaw. In July 1946, after the Kielce pogrom, they left Poland and reached a DP camp Heidenheim in Germany. In July 1949 the Rabinowicz family immigrated to Israel.
