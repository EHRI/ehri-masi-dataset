I'm An American -- Efrem Zimbalist

On September 7, 1941 Efrem Zimbalist spoke with Ugo Carusi, Executive Assistant to the Attorney General, about what democracy means to him. Zimbalist shares his immigration story. He confesses he never felt oppressed in Russia and did not initially come to America for opportunities. He explains the pioneering spirit of immigrant musicians. Zimbalist declares the American life we once knew is gone and we, as well as the rest of the world, are in transition. He points out the opportunities America offers talented artists. The professor talks about the history of America’s national music. Zimbalist admits studying abroad is not necessary to become a professional artist, because America is producing wonderful musicians. He shares his feelings on the current war and the mass emigration of intellectuals from Europe. The program ends with the scholar stating, “Making peace after the war is going to be more difficult to win than the war and a greater test of our quality.” Efrem Zimbalist was born on April 21, 1889 in Rostov-on-Don, Russia to Jewish parents. His father was a conductor and by age 9 Efram was first chair in his orchestra. He graduated from the St Petersburg Conservatory in 1907.
