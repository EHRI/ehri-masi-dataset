The largest body of the records Government Commissar for Abandoned Possessions was destroyed in 1956.

The Government Commissariat for Abandoned Possessions was established by decree on March 11, 1945. Its aims were to aid those who were personally impacted by the destruction wrought by the war and the German occupation and lost their homes, wealth and basis of existence as well as to aid those who were deported and help their return. The Commissariat was also responsible for the supervision and maintainance of abandoned houses, landholdings, firms, flats and furniture. The possessions that were left behind without legal inheritors were used to compensate those who were deported. The Commissariat was controlled by the Board of Directors composed of representatives of parties, trade unions and relevant ministries, especially the custodian department of the Interior Ministry, the custodian's office and the chanceries of Budapest. The Government Commissariat for Abandoned Possessions ceased to function in the abovedescribed form in 1948 and its successor was soon incorporated into the Ministry of Finance.
