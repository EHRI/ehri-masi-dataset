Himmler reviews Mohammaden SS volunteers

Heinrich Himmler reviews Mohammaden (Muslim) SS volunteers. These are most likely members of the 13th Waffen SS Handzar Division. The recruits wear fez hats and carry rifles over their shoulders. Himmler is accompanied by a man wearing dark glasses, possibly Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig, the German commander of the 13th Division. The men, now wearing helmets, perform a shooting exercise for Himmler. Himmler departs in an open car.
