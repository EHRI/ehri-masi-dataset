Korešpondencia Židov odvlečených zo Slovenska do koncentračných táborov

0,12 linear meter, paper documents

Collection was being processed by Elena Machajdíková.

Collection contains documents of the Jews who were deported from Slovakia to the concentration camps in Auschwitz, Terezín, Mauthausen, Kamionka and Petržalka in the years 1942 – 1945. Beside some original documents, the collection is created by the copies of correspondence of the persecuted Jews. There is also one document from 1945 which comes not directly from the concentration camp but it refers to stay in the camp – a health certificate. Rare part of the collection is created by the manuscript of Ľudovít Dojč on the concentration camp in Petržalka and photos of the grave stones from this site.
