In February 1942, Wolfgang Furrer (ZuÌˆrich, Switzerland, 1918 - 1972) became a political prisoner of Dachau. Furrer was arrested for resisting SS attempts to recruit Swiss nationals. He was transferred to Sachsenhausen in January 1945.

Wolfgang Furrer's memoir describes his experiences as a political prisoner in Dachau and Sachsenhausen. Additionally, the text includes a photocopy of an UNRRA document verifying Furrer's status as a former inmate of concentration camps and a 1953 affidavit by Gottlob Wandel relating the reason for Furrer's arrest.
