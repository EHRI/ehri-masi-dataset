1

Samuel Soltz was born in Bialystok, Poland. His father, Rabbi Gamliel David Soltz, died when he was school age and his mother died when Samuel was only 17. A member of a religious, Zionist youth movement, Samuel then left Bialystok for Palestine after first serving briefly in the Polish army. After the fall of Poland, he began his journey to Palestine, a journey that took him through eight countries and lasted 850 days. After stays in Lithuania, Kobe (Japan) and Shanghai (China), Samuel and a group of friends arrived in Bombay on September 11, 1941. They stayed there for 120 days. To support himself, he worked for the Sassoon textile factory. The factory illegally hired several Jewish refugees, including German refugees who were officially enemy aliens. He spent his free time at the Jewish Club, also owned by the Sassoon family. The club sponsored lectures and religious services. On January 16, 1942, Samuel Soltz and his companions left Bombay for Aden, and on February 2, 1942, they arrived in Palestine.

The papers consist of a Polish citizenship certificate bearing a visa issued by Chiune Sugihara, the Consul of the Empire of Japan to Lithuania; and a telegram from the Polish Relief Committee to Mr. Saburo, the assistant Japanese Consul in Vladivostok, Russia, bearing a visa to CuracÌ§ao in the Netherlands Antilles and regarding Samuel Solc's (Samuel Soltz) immigration to Palestine.
