Anti-Nazi cartoon published in Palestine in the early 1940s, with a quote attributed to the book of Proverbs from the Hebrew Bible. The quote is erroneously attributed to Proverbs 21. verse 24 but it is actually Proverbs 21:23. Posters urging the public to be discrete about what information they reveal in conversations with strangers were common during World War II. Both the United States’ Security of War Information Campaign (also known as the Hush-Hush Campaign), and Britain’s Careless Talk Series were created to deliver similar messages. Following World War I, The League of Nations awarded control of Palestine to Great Britain. After the British takeover, successive waves of immigration (Aliyots) dramatically increased the region’s Jewish population. During the Nazis rise to power, and outbreak of World War II, thousands of European Jews attempted to escape to Palestine. However, Britain placed strict limits on the number of Jews that could enter the country to ameliorate Arab concerns about the increasing Jewish immigration. During the war, thousands of Palestinian Jewish volunteers served in the British Army, and on September 14, 1944 a Jewish Brigade was established.
