Seymour G. Reitman served as a soldier during World War II.

The Seymour Reitman collection consists of handwritten notes made by survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camp and the Wildflecken on Danube (SS training camp) camp given to Seymour Reitman, a member of the US Army, shortly after liberation, circa 1945. Among the survivors were Jewish performers from a Yiddish Theater in Berlin, Germany who had been at Buchenwald concentration camp performing for the SS. The collection includes names and addresses of survivors, and testimony, in Yiddish, of a survivor named Yakov Leukovits, born in Skernievits (Skierniewice, Poland) addressed to E. Wolby of Los Angeles, CA, about the known fate of family members. Some notes were written on camp scrip.
