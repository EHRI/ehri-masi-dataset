Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 13 Nathan (Nikki) Hakker Project 'Late gevolgen van Sobibor'

Nathan (Nikki) Hakker survived the war because in the train to Westerbork his mother handed him over to a family who were in the possession of documents by which they could be exchanged with prisoners from Israel. Nathan's mother was deported farther shortly after arrival in Westerbork, and was gassed in Sobibor on July 1, 1943. His father arrived already earlier at Mauthausen. Together with his 'new' family Nathan ended up in Bergen-Belsen, from where he was forwarded to Tr√∂bitz at the end of the war. After the war until he was twelve years old he lived with a Jewish aunt who had come out of Auschwitz branded for life. He had an unpleasant childhood, he felt lonely and let down. From his twelveth year on he passed through several transit houses, boys' homes, and foster families. His childhood experiences were to have a great impact on his later life. Today Nathan Hakker is married and has three children.
