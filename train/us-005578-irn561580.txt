Contains photographs, almost entirely of unknown postwar displaced persons camps. Many photographs are labeled on verso as images of pro-Palestine gatherings, weddings, families, and events. Two photographs included in the collection depict Janina Zawadska in WÅ‚odzimierz, Poland, a Roman Catholic woman who hid Mania Lichtenstein and another child in the winter of 1943-44. Janina gave Mania the photographs.
