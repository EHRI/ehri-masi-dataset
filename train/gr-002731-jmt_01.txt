Αρχείο της Επιχειρηματικής Δραστηριότητας των Εβραίων της Θεσσαλονίκης 1920-1940

A hard drive (166 GB).

This exhibition aims to depict the significant activity of the Jewish population in the sectors of trade, small industry, industry and the related services in Thessaloniki, during the inter-war period. Information is drawn from commercial guides of the period, while the exhibition is based on original collectors’ material, such as advertisements, correspondence, photographs, share certificates and a number of objects that were either manufactured or commercially represented by Jewish businessmen. This exhibition, organised by the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki, demonstrates the enormous range of activity of Jewish businessmen and indicates their domination in sectors such as commercial agencies, retail trade, insurance and several small industries.

It contains information and archival material for thousands of Jewish and mixed sociétés anonymes (S.A.s) and sole proprietorships.
