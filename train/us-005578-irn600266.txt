Song nr. 29

Simone Arnold Liebster, was born in 1930 in Mulhouse, French Alsace. After the incorporation of Alsace into the German Reich during World War II, Liebster’s family suffered increasing harrassment from the Nazis for following the Jehovah’s Witness faith. Eventually both her father (Adolphe Arnold) and mother were arrested and sent to concentration and detention camps while she was placed in a correctional institution for “nonconformist” youth. Liebster has published an autobiography, Facing the Lion: Memoirs of a Young Girl in Nazi Europe.

Simone Arnold Liebster sings "Forward, You Witnesses!" in English, German, and French. Written by Jehovah's Witness Erich Frost in 1942 while imprisoned at Sachsenhausen concentration camp.
