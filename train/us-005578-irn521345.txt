Zygmunt Gemel was born on 28 April 1916 in Zalesice, Poland to Franciszek and Marianna Gemel. His family was Roman Catholic, and he had six siblings. During World War II, he was arrested on political charges in 1943 and deported to Auschwitz III-Monowitz (Buna) in spring 1944 and then transferred to the Dora-Mittelbau subcamp of Buchenwald. Zygmunt survived the war and remained in Poland.

The papers consist of a note written by political prisoner Zygmunt Gemel to his father Franciszek Gemel and thrown from a train while Zygmunt was being deported to Auschwitz III-Monowitz (Buna) in 1944, and a subsequent letter Zygmunt to his father from the camp dated 23 April 1944.
