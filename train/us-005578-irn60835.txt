Hans Yakov Vogel (December 3, 1926-1943), was born in Cologne, Germany, the son of Simon (b. 1898) and Hannah Vogel (b.1898), and had a younger brother, Walter (b. 1929). The family left Germany in 1936, settling in Paris, where they remained until the outbreak of war. Initially, Simon Vogel was interned by the French as an enemy alien at Lisieux, and later Gurs, and when the invading German forces reached Paris, the Vogel family fled south. When Simon was released from Gurs, the family reunited and settled in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, in the unoccupied zone, near the Spanish border. They remained from June 1940 until April 1941, when they received papers from the United States Consulate allowing them to immigrate, which they did, arriving in New York via Lisbon on the steamer Nyassa in August 1941. Hans Vogel died at the age of 16 from an illness in 1943.

Consists of one spiral-bound diary, handwritten in German with illustrations and insertions, written by Hans Vogel, originally of Cologne, Germany. The diary, which covers the period of July 24, 1940 to August 9, 1941, describes the Vogel family's life in exile in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, France and concludes on the day the family arrived from Europe in New York City in August 1941.
