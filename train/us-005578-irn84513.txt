Diaries kept by Alfred and Hertha Friedheim, with some loose documents inserted between pages; dated 1939-1941; in French and English. The Friedheims were passengers on board the MS St. Louis in May 1939. When the ship returned to Europe they disembarked in France, and were in the Rieucros concentration camp in Lozere, France before getting American visas. They set sail in May 1940 on board the SS Winnipeg, but were detained in Port of Spain, Trinidad after the ship was commandeered by the Dutch navy. While in Port of Spain, their US visas expired. They were successful in getting their visas renewed and received the necessary funds to pay for their passage. The Friedheims immigrated to the United States on board the SS Argentina arriving in New York on November 14, 1941.
