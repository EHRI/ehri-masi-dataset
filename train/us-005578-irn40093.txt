Documents and writings illustrating the experiences of Emma Muller (donor's maternal grandmother), an Austrian Jew who was interned in the Gurs internment camp in southern France, released, and able to immigrate to the United States in 1941. Included in the collection is the work authorization issued to Emma in Amiens, France; her release authorization from Gurs; a French rail ticket; and hand written notes that briefly describe her experiences. Emma wrote that she was interned in La Bastide de Bousignac (Ariege) and then Gurs; on a second note she wrote that she went 85km by foot, during bombings to Paris, where she was arrested, deported, and "beaten like an animal."
