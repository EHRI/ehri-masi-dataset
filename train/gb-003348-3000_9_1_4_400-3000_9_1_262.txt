Correspondence with Castonier, Elisabeth

44 letters

Elisabeth Castonier, nee Borchardt (1894-1975) was a German writer. When the Nazis came to power she left the country and settled in England eventually. Beside publishing books, she also wrote for several newspapers. See Castonier, E., , Frankfurt am Main, Ullstein, 1988.

Containing handwritten and typewritten letters the correspondence deals with two main subjects. One concerns German physician Georg August Weltz, who was tried, but not sentenced at the Nuremberg Medical Trial for experiments with inmates of Dachau concentration camp. The other one comprises numerous information requests on events and figures related to the Weimar Republic or the Third Reich. In order to complete her memoirs Castonier needed to clarify various details from these periods.
