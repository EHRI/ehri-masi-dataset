The “Series I: Geographic Files” contains interesting material on the Belgian Jewish community. Firstly we point out the reports on visits to Belgium and the situation of the Jews there (1947-1950, 1955); see box 5, folder nr. 41. Box 5, folders nrs. 37, 39, 42 and 43 contain monthly reports and correspondence by AJC correspondents (i.a. Regine Orfinger-Karlin and Joseph Lehrer) in Belgium, resp. for 1956-1957, 1945-1951, 1946-1948 and 1949-1951. Correspondence, various reports, press clippings etc. on general subjects (the Jewish population, refugees, anti-Semitism, contacts with Jewish communities such as the Communauté Israélite de Bruxelles, the Catholic Church and its attitude towards the Jews, Jewish organisations…) can be found in box 4, nrs. 31-33 for the years 1945-1949, 1950-1960 and 1961-1968. Apart from these general files we note files on particular subjects such as war crimes and anti-Semitism in Belgium (1946-1954)(box 4, nr. 30), Belgian alien law (1948)(box 4, nr. 34), indemnification legislation (1961, 1963)(box 5, nr. 35) and reports on the judicial status of Jewish refugees, victims and children (1945-1950)(box 5, nr. 40).
