United States Holocaust Memorial Museum - Curatorial Affairs Department

Consists of a photograph of women in the process of having their hair forcibly shaven and a photograph of the now-bald women standing and talking. The donor believes that the photographs were taken in France in 1945, and the women were likely being punished for collaboration with the Nazis.
