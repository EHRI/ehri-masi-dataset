Zionism; Travel to Palestine

A 1934 newsreel, and "advertisement" to persuade Jews from Europe to travel to Palestine via ship from Constanza (Romania). Original archive copy has title and censor's permission for showing in British occupied Palestine (can be viewed briefly in this video, in a few frames at the beginning of the story: TC 03:52:45:19). Segment depicts the first voyage of a Polish ocean liner to Palestine. The film contains crudely edited footage of the embarkation at the Black Sea port of Constanza, the passengers enjoying the pleasures of the open sea, the recitation of Yom Kippur prayers on deck, an extended cantorial performance, the dancing of the Hora and the singing of Zionist songs, the arrival in Haifa, and the urban vistas of that city and of Tel Aviv.
