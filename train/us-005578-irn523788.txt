Gustava was born in Warsaw, Poland to Joseph Goldzweig-Thursz and Felicia Weisholt and survived the Bergen Belsen, Majdanek, Mauthausen, and Poniatowa concentration camps. Their son Jerome Fein (1929-1974) was also born in Poland and survived the Holocaust.

Papers consist of documents, letters, newspaper clippings, and photographs relating to the experiences of Heinrich and Gustava Skovronsky [donor's parents] during the time period surrounding the Holocaust. Some of the photographs were saved by Gustava while in the concentration camps by keeping them wrapped up in her hair with a comb.
