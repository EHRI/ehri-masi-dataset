Includes a postcard from Szloma Erlich in the Łódź ghetto to her sister's family in the U.S. (Brooklyn address, but forwarded to New Jersey), dated 1941. Card written in German, but with Yiddish sentence across top. Pleads for them to send more packages with food, as their mother is elderly and quite weak, and wonders why they haven't responded to the cards she had previously sent. Also includes a photo reproduction of an image of a round-up of people.
