Grevenbroich.<br /><div>In 1936, Ludwig Liebermann was told by his manager not to return from his next business trip as the company would no longer be able to protect him, being a Jewish employee. He went to England in January 1937 and soon found employment as technical advisor and export manager of Fisher's Foils Limited in Wembley. His wife Susan Maria Linton (née Susanne Marie Friedmann), born in Vienna in 1902, and their two children Eva Maria (born 1932) and Albert Max (born 1935) followed him in November 1937.</div><div><span style="line-height: 1.22;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.22;">In May 1940, Ludwig and his family were separated and interned for nine months at various alien internment camps, including Wharfs Mill, Huyton and Douglas.

Susanne spent one month in prison before being transferred with her children to an internment camp near her husband on the Isle of Man.</span></div><br /><div>After the family's release, Ludwig could not find work in the chemical industry because of his nationality. He started working as a teacher and continued with this work until several years after the war. The family was naturalised in 1947 and changed their names by deed poll in the same year.</div><br /><div>Susan's parents, Leopold Friedmann (1874-1940) and Maria Lewy (born 1879), managed to obtain permission to emigrate to Argentina to be reunited with Susan's brother and his family in 1940.

She was a protagonist of the Austrian school reforms.</div><br /><div>Louis' parents, Alexander (1858-1940) and Elsbeth Liebermann (born 1859, née Neuberg), were married in 1894.
