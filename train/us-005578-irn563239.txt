Sigmund Neuberger (1890-1978) was born on 9 December 1890 in Hainstadt, Germany to Jacob (1850-1937) and Fredericka (n√©e Freudenstein, 1848-1912) Neuberger. He had three brothers, Berthold (1883-1965), Gerson (1877-1960), and Josef (1880-1961); and three sisters, Emma (later Emma Fischl, 1875-1965), Johanna (later Johanna David, 1878-1926), and Fanny (later Fannie Rosenbaum, 1887-1968). Sigmund served in the German Army during World War I, and received the Iron Cross. His brothers Gerson and Berthold and his sister Emma immigrated prior to the outbreak of World War II, and helped sponsor Sigmund, who lived in Zurich. He arrived in the United States on the SS El Oriente via Cuba in November 1940. His sister Fannie married Moritz Rosenbaum (1885-1948). Moritz was a World War I veteran, and had a son, Kurt. Moritz was arrested during Kristallnacht, and imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp from 16 November-7 December 1938. He immigrated to the United States around 1941.
