The Partisans, Pioneers, and Soldiers Organization (PCh"Ch) began its activity in liberated Poland in 1945, and continued its activities in Germany, Austria, Italy and Cyprus until the members of the organization made aliya to Eretz Israel.  The organization archives were brought to Eretz Israel by Shalom Cholovsky, a headquarters member.

The documentation includes material from the main headquarters of the organization in Germany arranged in 11 files.  Much importance is assigned to the hundreds of questionnaires completed by the partisans and fighters.  The questionnaires contain important details regarding the Jewish partisan detachments, the fate of the Jewish partisan in the Russian detachments and thousands of names of partisans who were killed.  Additionally, the documentation includes scores of photographs related to organization activities in Germany, survey-reports, leaflets and PCh"Ch newspapers in Germany.
