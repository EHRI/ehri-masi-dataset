Áldozati nevekkel kapcsolatos gyűjtemény

2155 files

The collection was created in 2004 as part of the Recording the Names project launched by the Holocaust Memorial Center (HMC). Name lists were partly provided by partner institutions and partly the product of archival research conducted by the HMC staff.

The name lists of victims and survivors held in this collection are culled from Hungarian state and municipal archives as well as from the collections of various foreign archives and memorials (Gedenkstätten)

The collection consists of two sub-collections:

1.	Locality name lists, including the lists of Jews prepared by the Jewish communities and the Hungarian public administration upon the orders of the Nazi authorities and the pro-Nazi Hungarian government in April and May 1944, ghetto name lists prepared in May-June 1944 as well as lists of victims created after the war by survivor organizations, memorial committees and individuals; 1732 files in total
2.	Concentration camp name lists, including lists of victims, transport and infirmary lists, registry cards and other personal documents from concentration and labor camps, sites of forced labour, the labour service and at execution sites; 423 in total
