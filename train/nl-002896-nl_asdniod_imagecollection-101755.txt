German Jew attends synagoge service again. A Jewish civilian, who came out of hiding when the Ninth U.S. Army troops occupied Krefeld, Germany, March 2, 1945, talks with U.S. Captain Marvin Goldfine, Jewish chaplain, after services March 29 which marked the reopening of the Jewish synagogue in the town. Jewish officers and men journeyed from U.S. front lines to attend and the synagogue was so crowded that several services had to be held by the Ninth army Chaplain.
