Instead he occupied various positions within the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (O.S.E.), and a director position of the "Fontenay-aux-Roses" home near Paris (1947 to 1957); a director position of the "Taverny" home (1957 to 1960); and of the Ecole Normale Juive in Paris (1957 to 1960). In 1960 he was appointmented as a director to the Jewish School in Zürich. From 1962 to 1985 Hausmann served as a delegate of the Jewish community Zürich to the Swiss Jewish Alliance (SIG).
