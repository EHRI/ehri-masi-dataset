Oscar Louis von Halle (1886-1944) was born on October 1, 1886 in Hamburg, Germany. He served in the military during World War I. After the war, he became an architect. In the late 1910s, he married Henriette Cohn (Cohen, b. 1896 in Berlin, Germany) and they had two sons, Hans Jürgen von Halle (May 7, 1921-1941) and Gerd Siegmund von Halle (later Gerald von Halle, b. December 12, 1922 in Hamburg, Germany) moved from Hamburg, Germany, to Amsterdam, Netherlands in the early days of World War II. The family spent time in hiding in the homes of neighbors, but was eventually discovered by the Gestapo. Gerd and Hans Jürgen were sent to Schoorl concentration camp in the summer of 1941. Gerd was released due to the fact that he suffered from tuberculosis. Hans Jürgen was later deported to Mauthausen concentration camp where he died in either July or September 1941. The Gestapo discovered Oscar von Halle in hiding in 1943 and sent him to Hertogenbosch concentration camp in the Netherlands. He was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he perished on January 31, 1944. Gerd and Henriette von Halle managed to avoid arrest and stayed in hiding until the end of the war. They immigrated to the United States with the assistance of relatives, the Charles family.

The von Halle family papers consists of correspondence, certificates, identification cards, and various other documents relating to the Holocaust experiences of the von Halle family in the Netherlands, including Gerd Siegmund von Halle (later Gerald von Halle), Oscar Louis von Halle, Henriette von Halle (née Cohn/Cohen), and Hans Jürgen von Halle. The papers include correspondence written by von Halle family members from the Schoorl concentration camp, Mauthausen concentration camp, and Herzogenbosch concentration camp. A manuscript entitled "Loss, Perseverance, and Triumph: The Story of Gerd and the von Halle Family" written by Jeremy Sanford von Halle was added to the papers.
