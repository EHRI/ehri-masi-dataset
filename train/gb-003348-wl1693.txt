Steffi Cohn: Letters from Siegfried Hoenich

1 folder

Dr Siegfried Hönich (born 24 November 1895 in Glatz) was a physician who last worked at the Jewish Hospital of Frankfurt am Main. He was deported to the Minsk Ghetto on 12 November 1941.

This collection contains personal correspondence from Dr Siegfried Hönich to his financée Stephanie ‘Steffi’ Cohn in Berlin. The last letters were sent to Steffi in England after she had fled anti-Jewish persecutions in Nazi-Germany. The letters document Hönich’s life in Frankfurt am Main and their efforts to emigrate.
