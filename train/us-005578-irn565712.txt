Collection of documents, photographs and correspondence related to Bernard Kornhauser, b. June 7, 1909 in Kraków, Poland and Jadwiga Gaschge Kornhauser, b. February 3, 1926 in Jarosław, Poland. Bernard Kornhauser was forced into the Kraków ghetto in March 1941, and two years later, during the liquidation of the ghetto, he was transferred to the Płaszów concentration camp. In October 1944 he was transferred with a group of men on the so called “Schindler’s List” to Brünnlitz. He returned to Kraków and went back to his dental practice. He and Jadwiga married in 1947 and started to apply for a permit to leave Poland. Jadwiga survived the war in Lvov, under a false identity of Zofia Jastrzebska. Dr. and Mrs. Korhauser immigrated to Israel in 1957.
