Various eyewitness accounts

1 folder

This miscellaneous collection of eyewitness accounts, detailing anti-Semitic persecution by the nazis probably form part of the several hundred testimonies gathered in the mid- 1950s by the Wiener Library, most of which now belong in the Wiener Library 'P Series'. In fact the first item (1267/1) is an account signed 'Li. Z.' of this project, dated 14 May 1956. It is possible that the reason why the accounts in this collection were never included in the 'P Series' is that so many of them are incomplete and/ or without author.
