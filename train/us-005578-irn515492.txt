George Salton (1928-2016) was born Lucjan Salzman on January 7, 1928 in Tyczyn, Poland to Henry and Anna Salzman. He had one brother named Emil. In 1941, he was forced into the ghetto in Rzesz처w and was transferred to the Rzesz처w concentration camp in 1942. He was later deported to a number of camps, including Plasz처w, Wieliczka, Colmar and Urbis (both subcamps of Natzweiler), Watenstedt (a subcamp of Neuengamme), Ravensbr체ck, and Wobbelin (a subcamp of Neuengamme). After liberation, he spent two years in various displaced persons camps in Germany before immigrating to the United States in 1948. While serving in the U.S. Army, he met Ruth Wolfberg, a fellow survivor. The couple married and raised three children in Rome, NY. After his retirement, he wrote a book, The 23rd Psalm: A Holocaust Memoir, and co-founded with his wife the Palm Beach chapter of Leah and later Insight, organizations dedicated to the education of young people about the Holocaust.

The collection contains one photoprint that depicts George Salton at age 17 in 1945, one month after liberation; another photograph, a copyprint, depicts George Salton's parents soon after their marriage. The four other photoprints depict members of Bricha (Berihah), an underground movement to transport Jews to Palestine.
