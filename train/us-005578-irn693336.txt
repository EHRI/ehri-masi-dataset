Veronika Camhi (née Hirtenstein, 1922-2004) was born 1922 in Budapest, Hungary to Deszö (1887-1968) and Gizela (née Kohn, 1891-1979) Hirtenstein. She had one sister, Susan (later Susan Schmiedt, 1917-2005). After the German occupation of Budapest in March 1944, Veronika’s parents were forced into the Jewish ghetto, but she and her sister stayed in a Swiss safe house. Her immediate family survived the war, but her paternal uncle Arnold Hirtenstein’s wife Esther and daughter Judit both perished at Auschwitz. Veronika married Joseph Camhi in June 1944 and their son Janos (John) was born in 1946. In December 1947 the family immigrated to the United States via England. After the war, her sister Susan immigrated to Australia with her husband Andrew and their daughter Judy (later Judy Wolfman) in 1951. Her parents also immigrated there.

Joseph Camhi (1916-1992) was born on 24 June 1916 in Budapest, Hungary to Avram (1881-1976) and Vida (1891-1975, née Behar) Camhi, both of whom were originally from Turkey. He had two siblings: Samuel (b. 1911) and Maurice (b. 1914). Joseph received his law degree in 1940, and worked as an attorney prior to the war. During the first few years of the war, he was conscripted into a forced-labor battalion. After the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, Joseph was evicted from his apartment and his personal belongings were looted by the Gestapo. He likely survived deportation by hiding in a hospital under Swiss protection. Joseph married Veronika Hirtenstein (1922-2004) in June 1944, and their son Janos (John) was born in 1946. In December 1947 the family immigrated to the United States via England.

The collection consists of documents and photographs regarding the Holocaust-era experiences of Joseph and Veronika (née Hirtenstein) Camhi, along with his parents Avram and Vida Camhi, in Budapest, Hungary. The bulk of the collection consists of documents regarding Joseph, and includes diplomas, passports and other identification documents, birth and marriage certificates, and business records. There are also documents related to forced labor in Budapest and property stolen by the Gestapo in 1944. Other documents include false baptism certificates for Joseph, Veronika, and their son Janos (John) used during their immigration to the United States, a birth certificate for Janos listing him as a Roman Catholic, and identification documents of Avram, Vida, and Veronika. Photographs consist of depictions of Joseph Camhi and members of the extended Camhi and Hirtenstein families, including Veronika’s niece Judit Hirtenstein, who perished at Auschwitz with her mother Esther, and Avram’s storefront in Budapest.
