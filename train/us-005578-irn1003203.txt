Hitler at cathedral; SA honor guard

Title: "Hitler follower buried in state - Germany's new chancellor leads 100,000 Berliners in official funeral for Nazi killed in inaugural riot." Bells toll as the camera pans across huge crowds of SA men. Hitler (in a Brownshirt uniform) is shown leaving the Berlin Cathedral, surrounded by SS men, as the narrator notes that this is the first time a state funeral has been provided for a private citizen. A brief shot of an SA honor guard, holding Nazi flags, switches to a bird's eye view, which includes the cross atop the cathedral, of the funeral cortege.
