Anschluss and Austrian enthusiasm

Starting with a map showing the borders between Germany and Austria fading, this footage illustrates the occupation of Austria by German military forces on March 12, 1938 and the enthusiastic welcome by the Austrian population shouting 'Heil' and 'Hitler,' waving flags, and giving the Nazi salute. Special occasions include the crossing of the border at Kufstein, the destruction of the turnpike at Passau, the occupation of Salzburg and Graz, the fraternization between German and Austrian troops in Villach, and Hitler waving from a balcony in Linz. Most of the film is shot in Vienna, showing: Austrian Chancellor Seyss-Inquart, Hitler Youth leader von Schirach, and SS leader Himmler. People entering the train station with destination Warsaw are described as 'fleeing Jews.' Hitler delivers a mass address about the reintegration of his native land of the "Ostmark" [Eastern territory; Nazi term for Austria] into the Reich, waves to the crowds while standing in a car, and watches a huge military parade. Austrians sing the German national anthem.
