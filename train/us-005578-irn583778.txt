Contains four vintage photographs and two copy prints illustrating the pre-war life of Sali Friedler (donor's husband) and his immediate family in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Sali, born in 1930, was sent on Kindertransport to Glasgow, Scotland in 1939 with his older brother Leo. Their parents, Charlotte and Bernhard, were deported to Riga, Latvia and Auschwitz-Birkenau respectively. Charlotte was deported from Riga to the Stuthoff concentration camp and was liberated in March 1945. She was eventually reunited with her sons in the 1950s in the UK.
