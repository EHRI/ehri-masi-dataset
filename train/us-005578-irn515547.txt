1

Lili Wider Blumenstein lived in Transylvania, Romania, until 1944, when, at age sixteen, she was taken along with her parents, Rachel and Samuel Wider, to Auschwitz. Both her parents died there. She was later sent to Gunskirchen concentration camp where she worked in an ammunition factory. After the factory was bombed, she was forced on a death march. She was liberated by Soviet troops on May 8, 1945, in Czechoslovakia, and spent time in the Leipsheim displaced persons camp before emigrating to Israel and eventually the United States.

The papers consist of a photograph of Lili Blumenstein and her son, Abraham, taken in Israel in 1949 and an identification card issued to Lili Wider by a Hungarian Jewish organization on May 20, 1945.
