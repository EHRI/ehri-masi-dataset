1

Consists of a photocopy of a typed English-language translation of a letter written to Leah Breakstone and the rest of the Breakstone family after World War II. The letter, originally written in Yiddish by a family member named ‘Toba” (who seems to be a sister of Leah), describes the fate of their family, many of whom perished in October 1941, likely at Ninth Fort in Kovno (Kaunas). The translation was completed on November 13, 1946 by Rabbi Maxi Felshin.
