Yehuda Zerzy Singer was born in Kraków, Poland in 1928 and immigrated to Palestine in February 1943 with the "Tehran Children," a group of children and Holocaust survivors brought to the country by the Jewish Agency after staying in a camp arranged for them in Tehran, Iran. After arriving in Palestine, Yehuda was sent with a group of children to Kibbutz Ein Harod.

The Yehuda Zerzy Singer papers contain a handwritten diary, photographs, and documents relating to Yehuda Zerzy Singer’s experiences in Poland and Russia during World War II and his life in Palestine after his arrival with the "Teheran Children." The collection includes school certificates, a postcard, identification cards, and photographs of Yehuda in Kibbutz Ein Harod. The diary was written, in Polish, by Yehuda from September 1, 1939, the day of the invasion of Nazi Germany into Poland, until the beginning of 1942, about one year prior to his arrival in Palestine. The diary documents the occupation of Poland; the plans of the family to escape to the east and the trip of the family to Lviv; the recruitment of his father to the army; the occupation of Lviv by the Russians; receipt of a letter announcing that his father was taken prisoner; his mother's work in sawing trees and his brother's work as a guard; and a trip by train and meeting new friends on his way to Tehran.
