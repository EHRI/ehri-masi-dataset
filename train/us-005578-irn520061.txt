Aba Sztern was born in 1922 and grew up in Paris, France, with his sister, Catherine. During the German occupation of France, Aba was interned in Beaune-la-Rolande. Subsequently, he was deported on convoy no. 5 to Auschwitz where he perished. Catherine Sztern survived the war and was later married to Willy Fogel, a child survivor of Buchenwald.

The papers consist of a Jewish New Year's card sent to Catherine Fogel by her brother, Aba Sztern, a prisoner in the Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp. In the card he writes that he hopes the family will be together before too long. Also included is a photograph of Jewish prisoners posing on a wooden bunk inside a barrack in the Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp.
