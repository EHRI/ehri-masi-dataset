The World Jewish Congress (WJC) is an international organization founded by resolution of the First World jewish Congress, which took place in August 1936 in Geneva. The organization goal is to defend the political, social, and economic rights of Jews throughout the world. Its governing bodies were elected at the First World Jewish Congress: the executive committee headed by Stephen Wise (also the organization’s chairman), an administrative committee, headed by Nahum Goldman, and a central council headed by Louis Lipsky. At the first session of the executive committee, Sept. 6, 1936, it was decided to establish regional offices of the WJC in Geneva, New York, and London, and a central bureau in Paris. The central bureau coordinated the WJC’s work, collected information on the situation of Jews in various countries, published materials, and also lobbied at the League of Nations. In 1940, with the Second World War under way, the central bureau was transferred to New York, and a European office was established in London.

The World Jewish Congress collection consists of the records of the New York Office of the organization. The Institute of Jewish Affairs, Series C, contains records of investigation of antisemitic legislation and activities, persecution of war criminals and war crimes, restitution for victims of the Holocaust, subjects relating to Jewish life and related problems such as minorities, migration, and human rights. The Institute produced reports for submission to the United Nations and other bodies.
