The <em>Reichsbund j端discher Frontsoldaten</em> was founded in 1919 to combat the resurgence of antisemitism during WWI. From the outset it was both a defence organisation and a veterans' association. It endeavoured to be apolitical but was regarded as assimilationist when compared with other Jewish organisations such as the <em>Zionist Centralverein</em>. It became the second largest German Jewish organisation with 30-40,000 membership at its peak, publishing its own fortnightly newspaper, <em>Der Schild</em>.<p>By 1924, at its national congress the R.j.F. resolved to include physical training for the young. Atheletics and, in particular, boxing were promoted, the latter as a form of self-defence and a means to counter the claim that Jews were weak and cowardly.</p>As antisemitism increased during the Weimar years, links with other non-Jewish veterans' associations decreased. By the time the Nuremberg race laws had been brought into force, any privileges that the <em>Reichsbund</em> might have enjoyed, by virtue of members' service to the fatherland, were gone.
