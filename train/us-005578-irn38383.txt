Consists of one memoir, 6 pages, entitled "Clandestinely: 1943-1945," by Peter Cullman, originally of Berlin, Germany. In the memoir, he describes the difficulties in his parents' marriage, as his mother, Betty Simonstein, was Jewish and father, Albert Cullmann, was Christian. Though Betty tried to convert to Christianity, she was still subject to antisemitic persecution. In 1942, she obtained a forged working pass, and, posing as an Aryan, she was able to evacuate Berlin with her children in 1943 to the town of Domnau. In the fall of 1944, they were forced to flee multiple times to escape from Allied bombing raids. He describes the end of the war, life in the American zone, and his memories of returning to Berlin in 1946. His parents were divorced in 1947. Also includes a one page biographical summary of the family's story, entitled "Clandestine life during the Nazi years."
