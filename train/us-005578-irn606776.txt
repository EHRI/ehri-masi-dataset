Sylvia joined the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and worked in the United States zone in Germany after the war. Sylvia Neulander died in 1989.

The Sylvia Neulander collection consists of a letter written by Sylvia Neulander, who worked for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) after the war in the US Zone of Germany; addressed to Sylvia's sister Alice in 1946. In the letter, Sylvia describes accompanying a group of orphaned children from Marseille to Eretz Israel (Palestine) in April 1946, and visiting other children who previously had gone to Kibbutz Buchenwald. The collection also includes a photograph of Sylvia in uniform.
