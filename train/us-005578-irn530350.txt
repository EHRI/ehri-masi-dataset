Hersz Iteld (sometimes referred to as Zeidy, later known as Harry, 1890-1969) was born in Brańsk, Poland to Judas Gitel Naiman and Nochum Iteld (b. 1859). He had eight brothers and sisters: Lazar, Menucha, Avram, Hinka, Nechome, Ruven, Sholem, and Nachman. All his siblings but Sholem were killed in the Holocaust. Guta Shereshefsky (1897-1990) was born in Szczuczyn, Poland to Ewa Rosenthal (Chava) and Sholem Shereshefsky (1863-1898). She had six brothers and sisters: Nchama (d.1939), Chaye Soro, Libbie (later Libbie Steinsapir, 1887-1967), Morris, Malah (1891-1961), and Joseph. Chaye Soro was killed in the Holocaust. Hersz and Guta married in Szczuczyn in 1923. They had two children, Chava (later Evelyn Iteld Silverboard, 1924-2005) and Yehuda (later Julius, 1929-1990). Hersz worked as a textile merchant in Brańsk. By 1937, Hersz and Guta had begun to make plans to emigrate from Poland. Guta’s sister Libbie immigrated to the United States around 1901, and sponsored them to immigrate there as well. They left Brańsk in September, 1938, sailing to England, and then taking the RMS Scythia to the United States. They stayed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with Libbie until 1941, when they settled in Atlanta, Georgia.

The collection contains correspondence, identification and immigration papers, and photographs documenting the Iteld family’s pre-war life in Brańsk, Poland, and their immigration to the United States in 1938. Included are immigration cards and documents, an autograph book, passport, and a day planner from 1938. There are also two post-war photograph albums documenting the Iteld and Shereshefsky families in Brańsk, as well as their new lives in the United States. The albums are annotated with identifications of relatives and friends.
