Correspondence with Buckeridge & Braune

28 letters

Buckeridge & Braune, Solicitors was a London-based law firm that employed several Jewish-German lawyers who had fled their home country after the Nazi seizure of power.

Correspondence, with refugees Rudolf Graupner and Hans Jacobi almost exclusively, regarding restitution related information requests, and the lending of certain materials from the Library. The enquiries include among others former camps Westerbork, Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and Sobibor. Moreover, Jacobi’s own restitution claim in West Germany, his Library membership and his authorship of a book review, published in the Library’s Bulletin, are mentioned.
