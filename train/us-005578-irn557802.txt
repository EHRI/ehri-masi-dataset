Saul Lilienthal (1877-1944) was born on 21 October 1877 in the village of Jeruty, East Prussia (present day Szczytno County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland) to Heiman and Cecilia Lilienthal (née Loewy). He had one sister, Johanna (later Johanna Deutschland), and three brothers, Samuel, Abraham (1885-1956), and Herbert. Johanna immigrated to Montevideo, Uruguay by 1932, and remained there for the duration of her life. Bertha Fuchs (1880-1943) was born on 26 May 1880 in Stadtlengsfeld, Germany to Sandel (1848-1906) and Jeanette (née Goldschmit, 1847-1901) Fuchs. She had one sister, Therese (later Therese Klein, 1879-), and one brother, Hugo (1878-1949). Hugo was a rabbi in Chemnitz, Germany until 1939 when he immigrated to Argentina where he remained for the duration of the war. Saul married Bertha in 1905 and they had three sons, Lebrecht (1906-1943), Theodor (1908-1987), and Felix (1921-1986).

In 1938, Felix emigrated from Wiesbaden to Treinta y Tres, and then to Montevideo. He remained there for the duration of the war. He married Elisabeth Salfeld (1920-1988) and they had one son, Alejandro. Theodor immigrated to Göteborg, Sweden by 1938. Lebrecht and his wife Juliette (née Prins, 1905-1943) immigrated to Amsterdam, The Netherlands by 1938. Their daughter, Marion (1940-1943) was born in 1940. Saul and Bertha joined them in 1939.
