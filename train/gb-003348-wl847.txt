Siegfried Rotholz: personal papers

6 folders

The collection was never formally accessioned. However a note, dated March 1990, states that it was deposited by a Mr Daniels.

These mostly original personal papers of Siegfried Rotholz, a German Jewish former resident of Berlin, who was transported to Australia on the 'Dunera', document his experiences as a refugee and his attempts to gain restitution money from the German government. Of particular interest is his account of the trip on the 'Dunera', replete with descriptions of the suffering endured by the internees, 847/3.
