Leo (Leopold) Weinberger (1923-2005) was born in Frankfurt am Main to Moritz (Morris, 1884-?) and Bertha Weinberger (1888-1988). His sister Ilse (1915-2006) immigrated to the United States in 1934 and married Kurt Goldbeck. Leo and his parents immigrated in 1936 aboard the RMS Queen Mary. Leo became a citizen in 1943 and served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1946.

The Leo Weinberger papers consist of Weinbergerâ€™s report cards from Frankfurt am Main, an immunization certificate and identification card, stationery from the hotels where he stayed en route to America, stationery and menus from aboard the Queen Mary, and two versions of the diary he wrote on his immigration journey to the United States.
