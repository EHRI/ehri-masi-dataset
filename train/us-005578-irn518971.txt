Magda Nemeth testimony

1

Consists of written testimony by Magda Nemeth, a survivor from Budapest, Hungary. The testimony is told in the form of short stories, entitled "Quicksand," "The Real Klara," "Rozsa Sandor," "The Lost Art of Survival," "The Twenty-Five Days: The Siege of Budapest," and "The Last Christmas Eve." The stories describe her memories between May 1944-1945, including her rescue of her younger sister from deportations in the Hungarian countryside, and her rescue from a firing squad at the Radetzky military barracks in Budapest, thanks to the intervention of Raoul Wallenberg. She also donated a copy of "An Occurence in Budapest on Holy Christmas Even Day, 1944" and the scholarly article "Psychosis in a Concentration Camp Survivor" to the Museum's Library.
