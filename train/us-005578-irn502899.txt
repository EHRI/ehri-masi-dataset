Kaminsky, Roman

Consists of poetry and songs in Russian relating to German and Stalinist camps from the 1930s to the 1950s. The individual songs and poems were written by camp survivors in Yiddish. In the 1980s they were compiled and translated to Russian by Roman Kaminsky. The compilation includes personal accounts of eight Holocaust survivors which describe what role music and poetry played in their daily life and their struggle for survival. Also included are survivor accounts of life in Treblinka, Majdanek, and other death camps.
