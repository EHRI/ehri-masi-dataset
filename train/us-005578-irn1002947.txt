Translation of Russian narration: Many Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, and other Eastern Europeans who were forced to mobilization by the Bolsheviks and later on taken as prisoners of the war, have been freed for their good behavior and are now making their path to start their usual work. Right now we can see a group of former prisoners at one of the Berlin stores who are purchasing civil clothes for themselves. Tomorrow they will start their usual work according to their civil profession.
