Rabbi David Eliach is 7th generation Jerusalemite; born in 1922. In 1943 the "Bnei Akiba" movement asked him to work with Teheran Children for just a few weeks. He was taken by the suffering of the children and felt it was his duty to guide the orphan children. He put aside his law school plans and devoted himself to the children of the Motza colony. In later years Rabbi Eliach was a principal of the high school of the Flatbush yeshiva in Brooklyn, NY.

Collection of photographs depicting the "Teheran Children," a group of approximately seventy observant children out of a group of 861 Jewish orphans, who were placed in the "Motza" children's agricultural colony under the leadership of David Eliach.
