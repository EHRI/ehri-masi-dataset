1 folder

Frederick Ernest ('Fred Ernst') Wolffing was born on 28 March 1930 in Würzburg, Bavaria. He was the only child of Simon Wolffing born on 17 February 1884 in Würzburg (who died in 1979) and Irene Wolffing born on 13 May 1903 in Frankfurt, Hesse (who died in 1969). It is believed that the family emigrated to England just before 1939. In August 1947 Simon and Irene Wolffing became naturalised British citizens. Simon's death certificate shows that he was a retired manufacturer of plastics. The family once owned some land in Frankfurt which was sold during the lifetime of Fred Wolffing.
