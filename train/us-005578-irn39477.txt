United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of one memoir, untitled, 21 pages, by Rose Doery (born Roza Hartz), originally of Amsterdam, Holland. She describes pre-war life in Amsterdam, her memories of the Jewish holidays, and her non-Jewish friends. In 1941, the family store was confiscated and in 1942, Roza managed to temporarily escape deportation by feigning appendicitis. On October 2, 1942, the family was deported to Westerbork, where they lived until February 1944, when they were sent to Bergen-Belsen. In the spring of 1945, they were placed on a train evacuating Bergen-Belsen, and were transported throughout Germany until the train was abandoned and they were liberated by the Russians. Roza's father died during the transport and Roza, her mother, and brother had typhus. After her recovery, Roza married and immigrated to the United States in 1948. She also describes her post-war life.
