Consists of one memoir, 101 pages, entitled "Only a Goat Walks Backwards: The Life of Fanny Eichenblat,",as told to Dr. Alan David Kaye and Dr. Brian Horowitz. Fania Eichenblat was born in a town near Lublin, Poland, in 1938. In the memoir, she reflects upon her life as a Holocaust survivor and how her father arranged for the family to hide in a dirt hole under a stable for 2 1/2 years. In the spring of 1944, her brother and father were killed while trying to find food and the family was forced to leave their hiding place to find a new one in a hay barn. They were liberated by the Soviet Army two weeks later. After the war, Fania's mother remarried and her stepfather, David, helped the family immigrate to Italy, where they lived until 1947, when they immigrated to the United States. She married Joseph in 1957, had three children, divorced, and married Gideon in 1977, and lives in Tucson.
