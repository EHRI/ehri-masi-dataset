Antisemitic scrapbook

oversize box

1

Contains a scrapbook with newspaper clippings dated 1938-1939, with international headlines from newspapers in the United States. Includes hand-written comments, underlining, and other notations inserted periodically. Includes several headlines about Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, some clippings from German publications, and articles about Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA. The creator of the scrapbook was apparently a graduate of that college; one clipping about Franklin & Marshall includes the handwritten notation, "The Jewish invasion of my alma mater is on with a vengeance."
