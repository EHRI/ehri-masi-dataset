Harriet Postman was born in Poland circa 1902. She and her husband, Abraham Postman, both immigrated to the Unites States by 1931 and became naturalized citizens. Flora Hochsinger was born in Vienna in 1878. In June 1942 she was deported to Maly Trostinec and killed almost immediately.

The Harriet Postman correspondence documents Postman's unsuccessful efforts to assist Flora Hochsinger's immigration to the United States from Vienna. Letters include correspondence between Flora Hochsinger and Harriet Postman as well as between Postman and relatives, friends, and aid agencies Postman contacted for help, such as the Boston Committee for Refugees, B'nai Brith, and Eleanor Roosevelt.
