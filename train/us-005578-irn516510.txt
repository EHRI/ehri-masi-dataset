In November 1942, Temczyn was selected for deportation to Sobibor concentration camp. While en route, he escaped and eventually joined a partisan group, A.L. (Armja Ludowa) that was part of the leftist underground. Under his leadership, the unit, which contained both Jews and non-Jews, was active in the Lublin district.
