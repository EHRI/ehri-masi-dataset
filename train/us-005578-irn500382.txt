Julius Israel Stein (1894-1942) resided in Meiningen, Germany, where he owned the Meiningen Chemical Plant S. Müller. He was married to Grete Stein. After his arrest, he corresponded with lawyers and family members in order to prevent the liquidation of his business. He was later sent to Dachau in 1942, where he was killed.

The Julius and Leopold Stein correspondence contains photocopies of letters between Julius Stein and his brother, Leopold, among others. The correspondence relate primarily to the liquidation of Julius’ chemical plant in Meiningen, Germany, and Julius’ attempts to prevent such from happening. This continued while Julius was arrested and imprisoned in Buchenwald. The last letters are death notifications sent to Leopold concerning his brother’s death at Dachau.
