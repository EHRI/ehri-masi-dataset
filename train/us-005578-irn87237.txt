Miriam Onel was born on August 8, 1930 to Ilana Krasso Spitzer and Marko Mordechai Spitzer. They lived in Osijek, Yugoslavia (today Croatia). Marko’s father was Jakov Spitzer, and Jakov's brother was Sandor Spitzer. On August 18, 1942, the Ustasa deported Marko's parents to the Auschwitz death camp. Miriam, Ilana, and Ilana’s mother escaped and spent the next three years on the run. In April 1945, after liberation, Ilana and Marko were reunited. The family lived in Belgrade until 1948, and after the State of Israel was established in May 1948, the Spitzer family immigrated to Israel.

The Marko Spitzer photographs include three photographs of the family of Marko Spitzer’s uncle Sandor in Osijek, Yugoslavia (today Croatia). The photographs depict Sandor, Ema and Ivica with Ema's family in Osijek; Ivica walking in Osijek circa 1939; and Sandor and Ema with Ivica circa 1930.
