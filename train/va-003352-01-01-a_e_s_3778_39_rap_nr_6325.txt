Le nonce à Berne Bernardini au cardinal Maglione

One letter.

Bernardini reports Maglione the difficulties he is facing in order to help Jewish refugees. Bernardini says he contacted on this matter the Lucerne-based « Unione Svizzera di Carità », and relates that South-American Embassies and Consulates in Switzerland became much stricter on issuing visas, even to Catholics.
