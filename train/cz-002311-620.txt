The municipal documents were stored at the town hall in earlier times. Parts of the documents were destroyed in fires. The first appraisal was probably carried out in 1955 by an archivist. Other additions to the fonds date from 1958, 1965, 1970 and 1971. The fonds was processed and an inventory made in 1978. The archive material of the town of Malenovice and the local national committee was organized into one fonds mainly because the minutes of the meetings of the council and the board and the financial commission continued to be made without interruption even after 1945, and also because the local national committee was active for only three years.

The earliest record of Malenovice dates from 1321. It was promoted to a market town in the 1460s. The last owner of the Malenovice estate and the castle was the Šternberk family (1804–1945), which also performed patrimonial administration of the town until 1849. After the reforms of 1848–1849, the district governor's office in Holešov (1850–1855), the mixed district office of Napajedla (1855–1868), and the political district of Uherské Hradiště (1868–1935), performed first-instance supervision over the municipality. From 1935, it was part of the newly established political district of Zlín. Since 1 January 1949, Malenovice became part of the newly established town of Gottwald called Gottwaldov VIII -Malenovice.

The fonds contains documents of the municipality self-government. With its scope, it belongs to the fonds of small towns.
