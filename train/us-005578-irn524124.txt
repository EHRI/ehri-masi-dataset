United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of one post-war document, undated, containing a description of the experiences of the men in Transport "EK." On September 28, 1944, almost 2500 people were deported from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. In October, the group of men who survived the initial selection were divided into transports for forced labor. Transport "EK" was sent to the Taucha concentration camp, where they spend the rest of the war assembling German weaponry in the Hasag factory. The document also gives a description of the route the men took during a forced march in April and May 1945, before they were liberated on May 9, 1945. Gerald Friedberger (donor's husband) was a survivor of the transport.
