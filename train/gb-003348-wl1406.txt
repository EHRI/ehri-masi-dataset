Primo Levi biography: papers

18 boxes, 92 photos

This collection of papers was generated by Ian Thomson whilst researching his biography of Primo Levi [<em>Primo Levi</em>, Vintage, 2003]

The majority of the material is secondary. A wide range of publications and unpublished articles on all aspects of his life and work is represented here. In addition, a unique collection of transcript interviews with friends, colleagues and relatives, and Primo Levi, himself, provides a special dimension to the collection.
