Elisabeth Model was born in Bayreuth, Germany, in 1897. She had four brothers and sisters, including a twin. She married in 1922 and moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, working as a sculptor. Following Kristallnacht, Elisabeth returned to Germany to attempt to help her mother emigrate. Through cooperation with a Dutch underground organization, Elisabeth was able to help her mother escape to the Netherlands. In 1940, her husband was imprisoned for one month by the Nazis on a false charge of smuggling money into the Netherlands. In 1941, Elisabeth and her husband bribed a woman at the Spanish Consulate to give them exit visas. Elisabeth and her husband were able to travel to Madrid, Spain, eventually immigrating to New York in 1942.
