Louis Oppenheimer (?-1967) owned a clothing business and lived in Frankfurt, Germany with his wife (?-1967) and two children, Alfred (c. 1915-1991) and Eleanor (born Lore, 1919). Alfred immigrated to the United States in 1937. After Kristallnacht, Louis was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp where he was imprisoned for four weeks. His brother, Moritz Oppenheimer (b. 1878), was also taken to Buchenwald, but was released because of his age. After her father's return, Eleanor left for France in early 1939 and stayed with family friends for two weeks before immigrating to the United States. Her parents left for England in 1939 and waited several months for their visas. In 1941, they joined their children in America.

The Louis Oppenheimer papers include a memoir written in 1939 by Louis Oppenheimer recounting his four-week internment in Buchenwald concentration camp as well as a transcription of a questionnaire answered by Eleanor Oppenheimer, Louis' daughter, relating to her family history.
