Dark is the Night | Odessa Kostia

Songs from the 1943 Soviet feature film, Два бойца, Dva boitsa (Two Warriors), Uzbekfilm. Songs performed by Mark Bernes, who portrayed soldier Arkadii Dziubin in the film, and recorded in Tashkent in 1943. The sentimental "Dark is the Night" captures the feelings of an army conscript whose thoughts dwell on his family and hometown. By contrast the lively "Odessa Kostia" narrates the antics of the title character, a sailor from Odessa. Both songs were immediate hits during the war, and "Dark is the Night" remains popular to this day.
