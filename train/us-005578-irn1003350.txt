Defeat of France; Hitler with Mussolini

Hitler surrounded by top Nazi leaders. Close up of Hitler speaking, smiling. General Keitel presents a document to Hitler for his signature. The narrator states that after the capitulation of Petain, Keitel is obtaining Hitler's signature on an invitation for Mussolini to come to Munich, which happened in mid-June 1940. A shot of Hitler looking happy, smiling with others, as the narrator exults that France is defeated. In his 1995 documentary about Hitler's cameraman, Walter Frentz, Juergen Stumpfhaus asserts that Hitler was somewhat unhappy about this piece of footage, because he was usually shown in a stern, serious light, and this footage shows him looking relaxed and carefree. Hitler nonetheless allowed the footage to be used, and Frentz felt that the German people responded well to this view of their leader [Eye of the Third Reich, Juergen Stumpfhaus. International Historic Films, Chicago, 1995]. Adoring crowds wave and salute Hitler's train as it travels to Munich. Hitler looking out the window of his train at the passing countryside. Passengers riding on a train on a parallel track wave to him. Hitler and Mussolini riding in a motorcade down a Munich street, hailed by crowds on either side of the street. Hitler and Mussolini wave to the crowds from a balcony at the "Fuehrerbau", a major party office building. Hitler and Mussolini inside, discussing the cease-fire with France. While France had requested armistice negotiations with Germany, it did not do so with Italy until Hitler interceded on Mussolini's behalf. This was the subject of the discussions in Munich.
