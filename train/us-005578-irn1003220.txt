New Cabinet Meeting in Berlin

Quick, soft, nighttime march of SS, SA, and stormtroopers with torches, flags. Inside the Hotel Kaiserhof, before the Cabinet meeting begins. Everyone in suits, gathered around, mingling, a bit disorganized. Posing for their first official photograph. Cabinet members include (according to BA documentation): Hitler, Goering, von Papen, Seldte, Gerecke, von Schwerin Krosigk, Frick, von Blomberg, and Hugenberg. EXT, Reichstag, Nazi elite spotlit in window. Murky shots of nighttime parade with torches.
