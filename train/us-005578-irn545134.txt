Die Juden in USA : uÌˆber hundert bilddokumente / zusammengestellt von Hans Diebow

The pamphlet was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2016 by the Katz Family.

The Katz Ehrenthal Collection is a collection of more than 900 objects depicting Jews and antisemitic and anti-Jewish propaganda from the medieval to the modern era, in Europe, Russia, and the United States. The collection was amassed by Peter Ehrenthal, a Romanian Holocaust survivor, to document the pervasive history of anti-Jewish hatred in Western art, politics and popular culture. It includes crude folk art as well as pieces created by Europe's finest craftsmen, prints and periodical illustrations, posters, paintings, decorative art, and toys and everyday household items decorated with depictions of stereotypical Jewish figures.

Nazi Party produced book with unflattering news photographs of celebrities and Jewish people in the United States, with insulting captions and selected quotes to negatively portray Jews in American life. Many of the photographs were supplied by the Associated Press. The pamphlet juxtaposes images of wealthy Jewish people with images of non-Jewish political figures, as well as the poor and homeless, as proof of the destructive and corrupting influence of Jewish wealth. This pamphlet is one of more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of antisemitic visual materials.
