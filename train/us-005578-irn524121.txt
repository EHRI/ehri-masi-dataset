Samuel Sigman papers

1

The Samuel Sigman papers consist of correspondence between Samuel Sigman and his paternal aunt Brajna Izrael in Małoryta, Poland (now Malaryta, Belarus). Letters from Brajna and Leibl, Mina, and Izak Grinberg (probably grandchildren of Brajna) address Samuel Sigman as “Sioma,” are dated circa 1936-1938, and convey gratitude for money sent and Rosh Hashanah greetings. Samuel Sigman’s letters to his aunt and to the JDC document his search for his family in Soviet occupied Poland circa 1939-1940. The papers also include photographs of Leibl, Mina, and Izak Grinberg in Małoryta in August 1938 and three photographs taken by a US soldier during the liberation of Germany around March 1945.
