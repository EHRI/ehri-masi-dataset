Jack Bornkind (1924-1945) was born on 31 January 1924 in Flint, Michigan to Nathan and Rachael Bornkind. He enlisted with the United States Army in 1942 and served in Europe with the rank of Private First Class. He was taken prisoner and was one of 350 American POWs selected from Stalag IXB in Bad Orb, Germany and sent to perform forced labor at Berga, a sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp. After a 20 day death march, Bornkind died on 23 April 1945 moments before the POWs were liberated by the US Armyâ€™s 11th Armored Division.

The collection contains two photographs of United States Army soldier Private First Class Jack Bornkind in uniform and one of his grave.
