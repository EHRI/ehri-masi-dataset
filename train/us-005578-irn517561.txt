Julius Neumark was a baby in the ghetto in Kaunas (Kovno), Lithuania, where he lived with his parents until he was sent into hiding. His parents also escaped the ghetto and survived World War II. Most of his other family members, including both sets of grandparents, were murdered.

The collection consists of five black and white photographs relating to the experiences of Julius Neumark during the Holocaust. Included are a photo of Julius's parents before World War II; a photo of Julius as a child; and three photos of his rescuers, Mr. and Mrs. Jonas Bieliajev.
