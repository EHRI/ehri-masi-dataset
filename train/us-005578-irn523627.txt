Roger Bordage was a fighter in the French Resistance during World War II. He was arrested in Mar. 1943 and spent two years in Oranienberg concentration camp.

Consists of a letter inscribed on pre-printed stationery from Roger Bordage to his mother Yvonne Bordage in Paris, France. The letter was written while Roger was interned in Oranienburg concentration camp, dated 3 October 1943. This letter was contained in an offical government envelope addressed to "Madame Bordagh" [sic] [donor's mother] in Paris; no signature on note or envelope, dated 28 April 1943. Also in the envelope is a typewritten note by a railroad worker explaining how he retrieved an additional note from Roger Bordage (not in the collection) when it was thrown out of a train onto the tracks after the departure of a convoy for an unknown destination.
