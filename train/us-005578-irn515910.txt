Ernest Hartog was born Ernst Hartog in 1928 in Aachen to Emil (1886-approximately 1942) and Paula Hartog (1894-1974) and initially lived in nearby Gangelt. His family moved to Aachen in 1937 and then to Brussels in 1939. Emil Hartog was arrested as an enemy alien when Germany invaded Belgium, and Ernest and his mother fled to Paris. Emil was transferred to the concentration camps at St. Cyprien and Gurs. Ernest and Paula moved to Lyon in 1941, living under the false identity “Ardolle.” Emil was deported to Auschwitz in August 1942 and perished. Ernest and Paula were the only survivors among their extended family, and they immigrated to the United States in 1947, settling in New York. Ernest married Sonya Salomon, a survivor from Luxembourg.

The Ernest Hartog family papers include biographical materials, correspondence, and photographs documenting the Hartog family, Emil Hartog’s imprisonment in the concentration camp at Gurs and his family’s efforts to arrange for his release through Father Alexandre Glasberg and other channels, and Paula Hartog’s brothers, Albert and Hugo Josephs. Biographical materials include authentic and forged identification papers; birth, marriage, vaccination, and prefectural certificates; and student, medical, and military records. Correspondence consists primarily of letters and postcards from Emil Hartog to his wife and son while imprisoned in Gurs. The letters describe daily life and conditions in the camp, his health, and efforts to secure his release, for example through the aid of Father Alexandre Glasberg. Additional letters document Ernest Hartog’s efforts to locate his father after his deportation to Auschwitz. Photographs depict Ernest, Paula, and Emil Hartog and Albert, Hugo, Erna, and Helga Josephs before the war in Gangelt and Aachen, during the war in Brussels, and after the war in Lyon.
