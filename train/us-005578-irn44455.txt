Consists of one memoir, 176 pages, entitled "The Fine Line" by Asriel Waldman, originally of Czernowitz. In the memoir, Waldman describes his childhood memories in Vicna and in Zastavna, his memories of his relatives, and of Jewish life. He describes the changes that occurred after the outbreak of the war and after the 1940 Russian occupation. The Waldman family was deported from Zastava on October 14, 1941 to Bershad in Transnistria and Asriel's parents both perished within the first year. In February 1944, Asriel, his siblings, and a cousin were selected to return to Romanian and travel to Palestine as part of a release of Jewish orphans negotiated by the International Red Cross, arriving in Palestine in July. He describes his service during the Israeli War of Independence, as well as his marriage, family, and post-war employment.
