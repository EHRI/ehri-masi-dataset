Hugo and Fred moved to relatives in Berlin; his wife went to Gurs, France where she worked as a nurse. Nothmann was captured by the Gestapo and transported to Terezin ghetto where he was involved in educating children. Once Terezin was liberated he was transported to DP camp Deggendorf. Both, his wife and son perished in the Holocaust.
