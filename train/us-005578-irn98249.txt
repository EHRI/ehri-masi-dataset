This collection contains documents of civil and criminal cases investigated by the court, as well as a registry of economic enterprises and cooperatives. The given survey included only a category of files resulting from applications to acknowledge the death of individuals submitted by other persons. They concern, almost always, people who died during the German occupation (collected from their homes by the Germans, taken away to forced labor, taken away to concentration camps, etc), who did not return home, as well as people murdered on the spot, whose death certificates had not been issued because of various reasons. The titles of these files in most cases do not mention anything about the circumstances of the cases, because they cover only the name of the author of the motion and the name of the deceased person. It may be necessary to look through the entire series and to ignore those who do not meet the requirements of the survey. The files consist of thin volumes (5 to 20 pages) including an application to acknowledge the death of a given person, testimonies of two witnesses made out on standard forms, correspondence hereto and finally the decision of the court. These documents are the main source for compiling lists of the victims of pacification and executions and also much detailed and previously unknown information about the German extermination policy.
