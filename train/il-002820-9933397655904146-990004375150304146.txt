1 electronic resource (2 pages)

This is a letter by Felix Genzmer to the editor's office of "Das schwarze Korps", dated December 17, 1936. Felix Genzmer writes that he shares the opinion expressed in the two articles against Schmitt. He is further supplementing his own remarks: How in 1928 Schmitt voiced his opinion, the Weimar Constitution could not be altered in its basic regulations even by a law being able to alter constitutions. Felix Genzmer also mentions Schmitt's writings about Hugo Preuss and how Schmitt nevertheless managed to become Prussian Privy Counsellor and got various influential posts in the Party. Of major significance is how Schmitt presented himself as leader of the anti-Semitic movement recently. He admits that Schmitt is both very ingenious and flexible. The letter is signed with "Heil Hitler" and there are handwritten notes on the letterhead.
