Wlodek Richter was born on April 28, 1946 in Krasnoarmeysk, Russia to Genia Baksht and Wolf Richter (b. 1922). His mother, Genia Jewgenia Baksht (1924-1974), was born in 1924 in Kremenchug, Russia (Kremenchuk, Ukraine) to Chaim Lejb Baksht (d. 1973) and Ester Zelikowna Baksht (d. 1971). His father, Wolf Richter (1922-1974), was born in 1922 in Jaworzno, Poland. Genia graduated from high school in June 1941 and had applied to attend university. She and her parents were evacuated from Kremenchug shortly before the Germans arrived in the area. Chaim found employment in a wood mill in Kryukov, near Krasnoarmeysk, and Ester worked as a nurse’s aide in a local hospital. Genia met Wolf in Krasnoarmeysk, whom had fled Jaworzno with his father and uncle in September 1939, and they married. Shortly after Wlodek’s birth in 1946, the couple separated. In 1948 Wlodek, his mother, and her parents moved to Daugavpils, Latvia where Ester’s sister Rita lived. Wolf later returned to the family and in 1957 they moved to Warsaw, Poland. Wlodek fled Poland in 1970 after a rise in antisemitism and settled in Stockholm, Sweden.

The collection consists of photographs depicting members of the Baksht and Richter families before the war in Kremenchug, Russia (Kremenchuk, Ukraine); during and after the war in Krasnoarmeysk, Russia; and after the war in Daugavpils, Latvia, and Kaliningrad, Russia. Also included is Genia Baksht’s 1941 high school diploma from her school in Kremenchug.
