1 electronic resource (80 pages)

The file deals with Nazi propaganda distributed through the organs of the Anti-Comintern Pact organisation, which was an ideological confederation of like minded, anti-communist states before and up until the end of World War II. Moreover, the file covers propaganda efforts of the German army to retain the confidence of frontline combatants in the "final victory" through pamphlets, leaflets and paroles. The file also contains anonymous counter propaganda and outright calls for desertion of German soldiers due to the inevitability of defeat by the hands of the Allies. The file includes budget proposals for the Anti-Comintern Pact Organisation as well as numerous, negative eyewitness reports depicting the hardships arrising from living conditions in the Soviet Union under Communism and planned economy. The reports have then been used by the appropriate authorities in the Anti-Comintern Pact Organization in the aforementioned propaganda materials.
