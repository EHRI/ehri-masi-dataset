Consists of a bound copy of a memoir, handwritten by Sara Weber Schwimmer, originally of Czechoslovakia. The memoir, addressed to her children and grandchildren, describes her childhood, memories of her siblings, and her memories of chores and recipes. She describes how various countries occupied her area, and her memories of moving to Budapest. She spent most of the war in Budapest, and remembers life in Hungary in 1944, enduring antisemitic persecution. She was ordered to perform forced labor and describes witnessing a mass shooting. She was then turned over to the Germans and deported, first to Buchenwald, then to Ravensbr√ºck, and from there to Burgau. The memoir is incomplete.
