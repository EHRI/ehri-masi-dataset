Of the eight children of Adolf and Emilie Gesnau, Steven Reiningerâ€™s grandparents, only two survived the Holocaust. Adolf and Emilie both died in Theresienstadt. Elisabeth Benesch, Steven's mother, and her parents Robert and Helena Benesch, lived in Vienna, where Robert Benesch had two leather goods stores. After the Anschluss in March 1938 the stores were confiscated and in June 1938 Robert was imprisoned in Dachau and later in Buchenwald. The family left for Prague awaiting their United States immigration visa. In March 1939, after receiving the visa they left for the UK in July 1939, and from there New York.
