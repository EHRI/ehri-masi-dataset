Whilst in London and later Darlington she worked as a German language teacher for HM Forces. At the same time she expended much time and effort in helping friends and family escape from Nazi Germany. Much of the value of these papers may be said to lie in the correspondence between Charlotte Lewin and friends and organizations which helped Jewish refugees. It sheds light on the processes involved in emigration and the conditions of life in Germany in the pre-war and early war years.</p>
