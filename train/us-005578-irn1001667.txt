Nazi propaganda: home front

The feature film begins with German families, including young people in HJ and BDM uniforms, running to a bomb shelter during an air raid alarm in Berlin in WWII. They discuss the endeavors of the German youth in the war effort. An older man recounts his own experience as an illusionist Wandervogel [wandering bird] before 1914 as romantic, utopian, and egoistic, whereas the 'hard reality' would now call for a different approach of the youth. Asked about their contribution to the ongoing "Daseinskampf" [struggle for existence] of the German people a uniformed member of the Jungvolk [young people, subgroup of the Hitler Youth] points out the activities of the youth: doing blackout painting, making errands, collecting rubbish for recycling, helping out in shops and offices, visiting and entertaining wounded soldiers, harvesting.
