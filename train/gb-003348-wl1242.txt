1 folder

The papers in this collection appear to emanate from the Bad Kissingen field office of the International Refugee Organisation in the American zone of occupation of Germany. The custodial history of this material prior to deposit is not known.

The International Refugee Organisation was a non-permanent specialized agency of the United Nations. It came into being on 20 August 1948. Its functions were previously carried out by a Preparatory Commission (PCIRO), which assumed on 1 July 1947 functions formerly exercised by its predecessor organizations: The League of Nations; the Intergovernmental Committee on refugees; the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration; the allied armies.<br/><br/>The IRO was concerned principally with the repatriation and resettlement of refugees. It also provided for the care and maintenance of refugees in Displaced Persons camps. The objective was to offer sufficient maintenance and care to prevent serious physical and psychological deterioration. In addition it gave legal and political protection, a function normally performed by consulates on behalf of their governments.

These papers consist of information sheets; administrative and provisional orders; and printed IRO statistics on the occupational skills of refugees.
