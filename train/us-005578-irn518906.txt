Abram Tseitlin was born and grew up in the small village of Ilyintsy, Ukraine. At the beginning of World War II, his family decided to leave, and made their way across Central Russia to the town of what today is Karmana, Uzbekistan. Jewish refugees were not treated well by the local population, and life was difficult for the family.
