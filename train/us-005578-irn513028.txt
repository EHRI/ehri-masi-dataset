Ruth Goldstein (neÃÅe Rotenburg) was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1932. At the end of 1938, her family was expelled to Poland. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, her family fled to the Soviet-controlled area of the country and was deported to Archangelsk, a Siberian labor camp. Ruth, her brother, and her mother eventually went to a collective farm in Uzbekistan where her mother died. Ruth and her brother were sent to an orphanage in Sobkhiz where her brother died, and she subsequently spent the rest of World War II in an agricultural school. Her father found her after the war, and they returned to Poland in 1946. Ruth joined the Gordonia (Gordonyah) youth movement and stayed at their hachshara in Niemce, Poland. In the summer of 1946, Ruth and 250 other children traveled to the children's home in Selvino, Italy. She remained in Selvino until her emigration to Palestine
