NSDAP Main Archive

134 reels

<div>The following information was provided by W. Glenn Campbell,Director of the Hoover Institution, Stanford, California in December 1963.<div><br /></div></div><div>Several years ago, the Hoover Institution undertook to microfilm in its entirety a group of documents entitled “Collection NSDAP Hauptarchiv” which were stored at the Document Center in Berlin, and administered by the U.S. Department of State. With the cooperation of the Department of State, the microfilming got under way in the autumn of 1958 and was completed before the actual documents were turned over to the Bundesarchiv in Koblenz, the current depository.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The 134 reels of microfilm of the “Collection NSDAP Hauptarchiv” are based on the archive originally established by the National Socialist Party to preserve the most valuable documentation on the Party’s background, history and organization. These documents will provide historians with an additional precious source for the study of the growth of National Socialism.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The microfilming was extended to cover additional material on prominent National Socialist figures held at the Berlin Document Center and includes selected items from its Collection Streicher and Collection Himmler, the originals of which are now also located at the Bundesarchiv. A listing of this material is included in this Guide although the material is not actually part of the NSDAP Hauptarchiv.</div><div><br /></div><div>Special thanks to Dr. Bernard G. noble, the former director of the Historical Mr. Isaac A. Stone, and Mr. James S. Beddie, former Heads of the Berlin Document Center, for giving generous assistance in solving the complicated microfilming procedures.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The completion of this costly project was made possible by a generous gift from Mr. John W. Blodgett, Jr., and Mrs. Morris Hadley, in memory of their father, John W. Blodgett. Additional financial assistance came from a gift of Mr. Richard M. Hunt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Professor Witold S. Sworakowski, Assistant Director of the Hoover Institution, initiated the project and carried all the negotiations to a successful conclusion.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The preparation of a detailed guide to this most complex collection of documents, comprising about 240, 000 frames of microfilm, became imperative. Without this research tool the scholar trying to find files in which he is particularly interested would lose many hours in frustrating search. The compiling of this guide was undertaken by Curator of the Hoover Institution’s Western European Collection, Mrs. Agnes F. Peterson, with the able assistance of Mrs. Grete Heinz. They deserve the gratitude of all users of this guide.</div>

<div>It may prove helpful to those consulting the “Collection NSDAP Hauptarchiv” to have an outline of the history and contents of the main archive of the German National Socialist Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP) and to know the stages whereby it reached its present form on microfilm.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the wake of its triumphal consolidation of power, the National Socialist party decided to establish an archive to preserve for posterity its own records and those of the Deutsche Arbeitsfront. &nbsp;On January 15, 1934, at the suggestion of Reichsschulungsleiter, Otto Ghodes, headquarters for an archive and library under the name “NSDAP Hauptarchiv” were established in Berlin.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Hauptarchiv was not without its forerunners. It seems that in August 1926 Adolf Hitler asked Frau Mathilde von Scheubner-Richter (the widow of Max von Scheubner-Richter, killed in the putsch of November 9, 1923) to start a press archive for the party in Munich. Frau von Scheubner-Richter worked there, together with Heinrich Himmler, for one and a half years. The press archives, according to her recollections, had three functions: to collect material on all hostile personalities, to check and clip the Communist press, and to check and clip the emerging National Socialist press. Around 1928, the whole organization was taken over by the Reichspropagandaleitung of the NSDAP, which also collected file copies of posters, leaflets, pamphlets, and other propaganda and election material of the party for the use of various National Socialist organizations.</div><div><br /></div><div>The NSDAP decided at the same time to bolster its political documentation by purchasing a collection on contemporary history started in 1914 by Friedrich Maria Rehse and organized in Munich as the Rehse Archiv. This collection was rich in material concerning the NSDAP. Hence, the intention was to set up the pictorial holdings and the realia of the Rehse Archiv as a separate museum on National Socialism; the printed material was to be amalgamated with the NSDAP’s own archive. These plans never materialized. The Rehse Archiv remained a separate entity, and after the war the bulk of the archive found its way to the Library of Congress; some duplicate items came to the Hoover Institution.</div><div><br /></div><div>The NSDAP Hauptarchiv’s first director was Dr. Erich Uetrecht, from the Reichsschulungsamt. The archive moved in October 1934 from the Maerkisches Ufer in Berlin to its permanent location in Munich, 15 Barerstrasse, adjoining Gabelsbergerstrasse, and the already existing archives of the Reichspropagandaleitung were incorporated with it. In mid – 1935 the entire oranisation was made directly responsible to Stellvertreter des Fuehrers Rudolf Hess.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The purpose of the archive was no longer exclusively that of acting as a central clearing house of information for the various party organisations. In addition to collecting books, newspapers, periodicals and government publications, operating a sort of reference service for party and government figures, and presenting occasional exhibits, the party archive was to be the main depository for documents related to the party’s history from its earliest days.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As a relative latecomer in the archival field, the Hauptarchiv had great difficulties in finding original material. The members of the party had made a revolution, but had not bothered to document it. With the help of newspaper advertising, leaflets, and questionnaires, the archivists appealed to old party members to donate their memorabilia of strife-torn days and to write down their personal recollections.&nbsp;</div><div>The archive had still other battles to fight in its quest for source material. The old established state archives were unwilling to turn over their collections of party material. Only the Munich police and the Bavarian political police gave the Hauptarchiv their pre – 1933 documentation on the NSDAP. In 1938, Dr. Erich Uetrecht wrote an elaborate memorandum discussing the reorganization of all German archives and assigning the Hauptarchiv a central place in the scheme. The eventual result of this memorandum was a circular signed by Rudolf Hess and sent in July 1939 to the various state agencies, directing them to collaborate fully with the Hauptarchiv; in response, these agencies drew up lists which enabled the Hauptarchiv to ascertain the location of files pertinent to NSDAP history, although the documents themselves were not transferred.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In 1939, the Hauptarchiv was designated as depository for the Stellvertreter des Fuehrers and the Kanzlei des Fuehrers, as well as the Reichsleitung der NSDAP. It was also given jurisdiction over the various Gau archives and the archives of the NSDAP “Gliederungen” (e.g., S.A., S.S., N.S.K.K., H.J., N.S. Dozentenbund (and the “angeschlossenen Verbaende” (D.A.F. and N.S.V., among others).</div><div>By 1943, it had become apparent that Munich was no longer safe from aerial attack and that the more precious holdings of the Hauptarchiv would have to be moved. Three Bavarian sites were selected for storage: Passau-Feste-Oberhaus, Neumarkt-St. Veit go up to March 1945. At the end of war, the American army seized what archives it could find in Passau and Neumarkt-St. Veit. (The fate of the Lenggries material is unknown.) The confiscated documents were then reassembled at the Berlin Document Center in early 1946.</div><div><br /></div>

<div>The Hauptarchiv was set up primarily as a depository for source material on which historians of the future would draw to write the history of the party. Its emphasis, therefore, lay on the years between 1919 and 1933. Material going back as far as 1890 was collected, however, to encompass the political and ideological forerunners of National Socialism, and although the spotlight was on the party itself, considerable importance was attached to parallel nationalist “voelkisch” movements and political opponents – for example, the entire files of the Deutsche Demokratische Partei were taken over by the Hauptarchiv. With its special ties to the Stellvertreter des Fuehrers office, the Hauptarchiv had high priority as a depository for the documents of the Fuehrer himself. (This was not the case with respect to other high-ranking Nazi officials, such as Goebbels, Goering, or Himmler). Around 1937, the Hauptarchiv undertook a series of investigations to make up for its tardy arrival in the field of party history by gathering reports from old party-members, such as Anton Drexler and Dietrich Eckhardt. It also collected information on party history from the various Gaue and the many Nazi newspapers thoughout the country. As the principal depository for the “Gliederungen” and “angeschlossene Verbaende” of the NSDAP, the Hauptarchiv received a number of historically relevant files, but the files of these organisations were not collected systematically for the post – 1933 years, except where whole document collections were taken over when an organisation closed down – as in the case of the Nationalsozialistischer Studentenbund.</div><div><br /></div><div>As a result, material for the years 1933-45 is spotty at best. It covers the Reichsparteitage (1923-39) in full organisational detail. It presents extensive information on the deployment of the “Gliederungen” and “angeschlossene Verbaende” in wartime. It includes correspondence from Germans all over the globe during the mid thirties. It covers scattered reports sent in from the Gau archives, including Austria, on party affairs, as well as on the political atmosphere in wartime Germany. As documentation on the relation of church and state during the thirties, the Hauptarchiv boasts the private archive of Abt Schachleiter, a prominent Nazi and Catholic Church dignitary.</div><div><br /></div>
