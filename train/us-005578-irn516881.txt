Paul Levy (1919-2006) was born Pinchos Lewaszewski on March 9, 1919 in Grodno, Poland to Efroim Lewaszewski and Riwka Krimsky. After World War II, Paul lived in Linz in the Wegscheid displaced persons camp from 1946-1947, in the Bindermichl camp from 1948-1949, and in the Ebelsberg and Asten camps from 1950-1951. Paul immigrated to the United States in February 1952.

The collection consists of three photographs of Paul Levy (Pinchos Lewaszewski) and other Holocaust survivors taken at Lager Wegscheid in Linz, Austria. Two photographs depict Paul Levy, his cousin, Sidney Habel, and other members of Kibbutz Dror gathered around a memorial to victims of the Holocaust in Linz.
