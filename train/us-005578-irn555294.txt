Photographs; depicting members of the Reiter family (donor’s maternal family), from Tyśmienica, 12 km east of Stanisławów; the matriarch of the family, Freyda Reiter, b. c. 1860 perished in the Holocaust. The oldest daughter of Freyda, Rose Reiter, immigrated to the US in 1902; four years later Rose went to visit her family and brought over her youngest brother, Samuel (donor’s maternal grandfather). One nephew of Rose and Samuel, son of Regina Reiter Vogel and her husband Israel Vogel, Salomon or Salo, graduated from medical school in Prague, Czechoslovakia and managed to immigrate to the US in February 1939. Salo’s older sister Rutka, who was a pharmacist, survived in hiding in Stanisławów; Rutka and her husband Markus Goliger immigrated to the US after the war. All the other members of the family were murdered during the Holocaust.
