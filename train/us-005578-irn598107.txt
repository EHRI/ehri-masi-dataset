The collection of Ole Barfoed consist of correspondence and reports, mainly from Jews relating to their escape to Sweden during the occupation of World War II, copies of miscellaneous documents from archives, and private notes. During the 1950s Ole Barfoed worked with some 70 Danish Jews who had escaped to Sweden during World War II and persuaded them to write down their accounts of their experiences from that time. The majority of these firsthand accounts were written by Jews who were well connected in society, and who also, for the most part, were above average in terms of personal financial status. They provide an invaluable insight into the thoughts and experiences of Danish Jews in 1943. Many of the 70 individual accounts involve multiple generations, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, friends, etc., and therefore describe the experiences of far more than 70 people. Note: Records are restricted, access only by the permission of the Danish National Archives. Access is granted by application and must go through the Danish Data Protection Agency since the material contains personal information.
