Mayor of Nuremberg: notice to Council officers

1 folder

<p>Typescript notice from the mayor of Nuremberg instructing council officials to ensure that they always use correct German, ie free from foreign influence<br /></p><p>These instructions issued by the mayor of Nuremberg to the city's council officials reflect the Nazi preoccupation with maintaining the supposed purity of the German language. The last paragraph strongly urges individuals, professions, businesses etc to be described in terms of their ethnicity; they are either German or Jewish. They can not therefore be described as being Christian since the latter does not define ethnicity.</p>
