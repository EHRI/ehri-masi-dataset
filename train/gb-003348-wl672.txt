<em>Alliance Israélite Universelle</em>, a Jewish organisation founded in France in 1865 as a reaction to antisemitism, the main aim of which was the defence of world Jewry and the <em>Ligue Internationale contre le Racisme et l'Antisémitisme</em>, created in 1928. The latter was not an exclusively Jewish organisation but its defence of East European Jews attracted many Jews and the tendency of many of its members to seek confrontation with antisemites on the streets brought it into alliance with left-wing organisations
