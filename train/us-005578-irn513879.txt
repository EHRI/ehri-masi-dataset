The World Jewish Congress (WJC) is an international organization founded by resolution of the First World jewish Congress, which took place in August 1936 in Geneva. The organization goal is to defend the political, social, and economic rights of Jews throughout the world. Its governing bodies were elected at the First World Jewish Congress: the executive committee headed by Stephen Wise (also the organization’s chairman), an administrative committee, headed by Nahum Goldman, and a central council headed by Louis Lipsky. At the first session of the executive committee, Sept. 6, 1936, it was decided to establish regional offices of the WJC in Geneva, New York, and London, and a central bureau in Paris. The central bureau coordinated the WJC’s work, collected information on the situation of Jews in various countries, published materials, and also lobbied at the League of Nations. In 1940, with the Second World War under way, the central bureau was transferred to New York, and a European office was established in London.

The Central Files (1919-1971) contain the history of the World Jewish Congress (especially prior to 1940); correspondence and other materials of important World Jewish Congress leaders (Stephen S. Wise, Nahum Goldman, Israel Goldstein and Administrative/Executive directors of the New York office: Abraham S. Hyman, Monty Jacobs, Yehuda Ebstein, Greta Beigel); and minutes and other records of plenary assemblies, conferences, and committee meetings. The Executive Committee files include material from the South American, European, and Israeli Branches of the Executive. Significant subjects covered include antisemitism, relief for refugees, and relations with the League of Nations.
