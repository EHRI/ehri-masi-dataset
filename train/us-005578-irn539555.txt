Benjamin Murmelstein (1905-1989), a rabbi and intellectual, became head of the emigration department of the welfare office of the Jewish Community Vienna after the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany and the reopening of the Jewish community under Nazi control on May 2, 1938. In that capacity, Murmelstein worked closely with Adolf Eichmann and the Central Office for Jewish Emigration. After his deportation to Theresienstadt, he eventually became the last head of the Jewish Council in Theresienstadt. Murmelstein was extensively interviewed by Claude Lanzmann for his seminal documentary Shoah but the interview was not used in that film. Lanzmann chose Murmelstein as the subject of his 2013 documentary "The Last of the Unjust" which is based on the interviews.
