Pavelic and Croatian Troops

Ante Pavelic (Nazi Croatian leader) strides toward camera at head of procession; children give him flowers; MCU smiling women on sidelines look on. MS Pavelic salutes uniformed men at attention as he walks down line shaking hands; officers follow behind. Croat flag is carried by marching, "Heil"-saluting male civilians (recruits to the Black Legion). Pavelic shakes hands with some within the smiling crowd.
