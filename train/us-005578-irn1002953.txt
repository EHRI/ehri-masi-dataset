Parade of SS Division Galicia in Kolomyja; Estonian Waffen SS battalion

Military ceremony for the SS Galizien in Kolymyia (Kołomyja). Men stand on a wooden platform in a field, surrounded by a crowd. They carry flags and military standards, including what may be a variation on the Lviv coat of arms (or perhaps on the West Ukrainian People's Republic's coat of arms, which itself is likely a variation on the Lviv one), several swastika flags, at least two SS standards, and a banner with sword painted down the middle, reading "For Ukraine, For Freedom, For Honor, For Glory. --- U.G.A. 1918". SS Galician Division parades through town, some dressed in traditional Ukrainian (and even Cossack) clothing, others in civilian clothing, others in military garb. Translation of Ukrainian narration: [Kolomyia (Kołomyja)/Galicia/Western Ukraine.] In Kolomyia (Kołomyja), Eastern Galicia, a manifestation of volunteer units took place. This area in North-Eastern Galicia contributed the largest number of volunteers to the newly formed SS-Galicia division. The governor addressing the manifestation said: "By joining these ranks of volunteers you confirm that you are not keeping apart from the European battle but together with others you accept the battle. You want to serve your homeland and a new Europe. Your fight is for a better and greater future. And this fight will continue until the very end." Shoulder by shoulder with the German soldiers these volunteers are going to fight against the Bolsheviks.
