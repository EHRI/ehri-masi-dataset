Jews in Vilna

Sound is a bit scratchy at certain points. Crowds of people at the annual Kaziukas craft fair in Vilna. Horses stand on muddy ground. Vendors sell round pretzel-like bread (Kaziukas bread?). A woman with a fur collared coat buys strands of the round bread from a smiling vendor. CUs of nicely decorated cookies and sugar hearts. Visitors to the fair look at paintings, caged birds, rocking horses, and other items for sale. View of giant crosses on a hilltop and aerial views of the city. Picturesque shots of alleys, cobblestone streets, and archways, while the narrator describes the city as a "Maerchenstadt" (fairytale city). Views of the many churches of Vilna. Another market (or the same one?) where people buy food, textiles, and other goods. A woman sells tea from a steaming samovar. Horse-drawn taxis wait in a row. 02:12:35 Brief shots of the Jewish quarter of Vilna while the narrator says that "Vilna still has a ghetto." The music changes from lighthearted to darker and more ominous. Shots of a cobblestone street with lots of people, which the narrator describes as "dark lanes in the business quarter." A sign in Yiddish is visible on the right side of the screen. The music becomes lighter again and the next scene shows a cloister.
