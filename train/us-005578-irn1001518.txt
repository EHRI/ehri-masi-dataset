Atom bomb havoc

Universal Newsreel, Vol. 18, No. 432. Release date, 09/10/1945. According to UN advance information: "Hiroshima-Atomic Bomb Target No. 1" When Col. Paul Tibbetts, Jr. winged his Superfortress over Hiroshima, that metropolis became the first target city for the new destructive terror--the Atomic Bomb. This single bomb, equal to 20,000 tons of TNT in explosive power, levelled 70% of the city, killed 126,000 and left acres of empty wastelands in the heart of a once thriving city.
