Regina Bader family correspondence

oversize boxes

2

Two albums, containing reproductions of correspondence to the donorâ€™s aunt, Regina Bader, and her mother and other family members, 1942-1943. The letters that are copied in this album were sent to Bader while she was interned during World War II in the Bernsdorf forced labor camp, a sub-camp of Gross-Rosen, and her family were mostly living in a ghetto in Sosnowiec, German-occupied Poland. Translations of each letter and postcard are included with the copied documents. The letters, which begin in May 1942, consist mostly of updates from Bader's mother about other family members, some of whom were interned as forced laborers in Blechhammer, Bunzlau, and other locations, and also allude to her own experiences in Sosnowiec and her work in Katowice. Following the deportation of Bader's mother in June 1943, the remaining letters are sent largely from her father and brothers in Sosnowiec, as well as her sister Fela, in a camp at Neusalz/Oder, with the last letters in this collection dating from July 1943.
