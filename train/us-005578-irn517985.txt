Consists of one memoir, 7 pages, entitled "Heldentum in Guers" (Heroism in Gurs), written by Dr. Ludwig Mann. In the memoir, Dr. Mann, who worked as an inmate doctor, relates his memories of "heroes" he encountered in the Gurs camp--people who cared for the sick or who volunteered to replace others on transports. The memoir is undated, but was written sometime before Dr. Mann's death in 1947.
