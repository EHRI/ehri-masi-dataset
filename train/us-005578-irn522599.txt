Ursula Wolff’s father was Jewish, and her mother Erna was a Mischling. Erna's "Christian" brother was drafted into the German army and died fighting in Russia. Erna hid Ursula with her cousin Dietrich J. Kijora (1929–2005) and his family from 1942-1944. The Kijora family was denounced by a neighbor, and Ursula was arrested along with Dietrich’s father Alfred Kijora (1893–1967). Erna was also sent to a concentration camp. Ursula and Erna’s fates are unknown.
