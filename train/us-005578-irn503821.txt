Paul Seres was a member of the United States Army and participated in the liberation of Ebensee and the subsequent administration of the camp.

Consists of 20 photographs depicting scenes at post-liberation Ebensee and a notice entitled "The Camp of Ebensee" with handwritten annotations by Paul Seres. The notice contains information about the evolution of the camp, conditions for prisoners, and atrocities committed by the camp commanders. It appears to have been written by a camp prisoner shortly after liberation. The photographs and the "notice" were collected by Paul Seres shortly after the liberation of Ebensee. An annotation on the cover states that it was presented to Paul Seres by a French prisoner in Ebensee.
