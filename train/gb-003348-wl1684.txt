Her mother Grete Klapper and her cousin Max were transported to Auschwitz in 1943. Whilst her mother's fate is unknown, Max died in May 1943.<br /><br />Renate trained to be a nurse and midwife in England. She later became a midwifery teacher and attended the International Confederation of Midwives Congress in Jerusalem in 1978. She supported various good causes such as the Ethiopian Gemini Trust for which she started a supplementary feeding programme which developed into a large organisation with a clinic, income generating activities for parents and a day care centre. She also contributed to the Princess Tsahai Memorial Hospital Trust, established by Rita Pankhurst's husband's mother, Sylvia Pankhurst. Renate died in Southend-on-Sea in 1998.
