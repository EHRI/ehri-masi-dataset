Paris; Workers/POWs; soldiers celebrate

Reel I: Germans in Paris, placing wreaths at the tomb of the unknown soldier, flags, wreaths, etc. March in streets, rally, Vel d'Hiv. Speaker: Jaques Doriot. Workers (men and women, some POWs) in a factory, in mines, etc. The music is very reminiscent of the opening theme of Beethoven's Third Symphony, Eroica. Reel II: EXT, soldiers clowning around outside of their barracks. Soldiers eat, sing, dance, pretend to be bull fighters, and generally have a good time.
