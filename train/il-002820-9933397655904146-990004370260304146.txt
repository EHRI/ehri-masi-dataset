[Carl Schmitt documents: Göring's letter to the "Schwarze Korps"]]

1 electronic resources (4 pages)

The first part of this file, headed "An II/2" (To II/2) contains a short note from the 13th of November 1936 signed by [Reinhard] Höhn. It says " Im Akt Schmitt hinweisen auf Akt Prof. Weber (PA 6592)" (In Record of Schmitt make reference to record of Prof. Weber [followed by his reference number]). Underneath this typewritten part there is a handwritten remark by Höhn, which is barely readable. The next part of the file contains a 3-page-letter [with the first and second pages being duplicates] from the 21st of December by [Hermann] Göring in his capacity of Prussian Prime Minister to the "Hauptschriftleitung of the Schwarze Korps" (main editorial office of the Black Corps [,the official weekly newspaper of the SS]) regarding this newspaper's articles about Schmitt in the issues 49 and 50. The titles of the articles mentioned are "Eine peinliche Ehrenrettung" (An embarrassing retrieval of one's honor) and "Es wird immer noch peinlicher!" (It is still getting more embarrassing!). Hermann Göring is stating that the articles are doing serious damage to Schmitt's public reputation. While conceding that their factual criticism might not be completely unjustified, he is telling the Black Corps off for its vilification of a person that was appointed to a high public office based on his [Hermann Göring's] trust in him. If there should be critic regarding a Prussian Privy Counsellor, they would be free to apply to him [Hermann Göring] directly and he would see to it himself to take the necessary steps where required. He cannot tolerate their treating members of the Prussian Privy Council like that. Hermann Göring requests them to cease their press campaign against Schmitt, publish an appropriate correction note in their next issue and submit to him [Hermann Göring] a deposit copy of the relevant issue immediately.
