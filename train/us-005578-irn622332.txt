Aaron Tunick (born Aron Tunik, 1904-1970) was born in Stołpce, Poland (Stolbsty or Stowbtsy, Belarus) to Mordechai Tunik (1877-1942) and Freida Kharoz (1880-1942). He had eight siblings: Abraham (1902-1969), Menukha (1908-1942), Relka (or Erela, 1902 or 1908-1942), Khasja (1909-1942), Yitzkhak (1912-1942), Henja (1912-1942), Mania (1915-1942), and Tzvi (1928-1942). Mordechai was a merchant. Aaron left Poland in 1934 to join his brother Abraham in Santiago, Chile. By 1935 he immigrated to the United States and settled in New York. He married Goldie Nitzberg (1902-1983) in 1937, whom he previously knew and had sponsored his immigration. They moved to Chicago by 1940 and had two children, Allen and Eileen. Aaron and Abraham’s entire family was murdered in the Holocaust in 1942.

The collection primarily consists of family correspondence received by Aaron Tunick, originally of Stołpce, Poland (Stolbsty or Stowbtsy, Belarus), after he emigrated from Poland in 1934. The bulk of the letters (1936-1941) are from his siblings, and in particular Henja and Yitzhak. The letters discuss a deteriorating situation, loss of their businesses because they are Jewish, a rise in antisemitism, and an urgency to flee Poland. A small amount of biographical material consists of a birth certificate and a Zionist Organization of Poland identification card. Also included are photographs depicting Aaron and his family and friends in Stołpce, Poland and his life after immigrating to the United States.
