Joseph and Caroline Schiffmann of Hoppstaedten, Germany had three children: Gustav Schiffmann, Isaak Schiffmann (1856-1910), and Johanna Schiffmann. At some point the spelling of the Schiffmann last name was changed to Schiffman. Isaak Schiffmann (later Isaac Schiffman, 1856-1910) immigrated to Huntsville, Alabama in 1878 where he joined his uncles Daniel Schiffman (1842-1892) and Solomon Schiffman (1835-1894). His siblings, Gustav and Johanna Schiffman, remained in Germany. On March 5, 1884, Isaac Schiffman married Bettie Schiffman (née Herstein, 1860-1932). They had three children, Annie Goldsmith (née Schiffman, 1886-1959), Irma Carolyn Schiffman (1890-1956), and Robert Lee Schiffman (1888-1936). Annie Schiffman (later Goldsmith, 1886-1959), the eldest daughter of Isaak Schiffman, married Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr. (1883-1972) on April 29, 1909 in Alabama. Their son, Lawrence Bernstein Goldsmith Jr. (1909-1995) was born on June 19, 1909. Lawrence Goldsmith Sr. served as the President of the I. Schiffmann & Company, Inc. and chaired the Alabama UJA Campaign, later known as the Huntsville Jewish Charities, every year without interruption from 1939-1954. Annie Goldsmith is listed as both a housewife and the Director of the I. Schiffman & Company, Inc. on the affidavits of support for her family members. Their son, Lawrence Goldsmith Jr., is listed as Secretary of the company. Annie and Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr., along with a cousin Elsie Schiffman in New York, sponsored the immigration of extended family members from Germany. They were successful in sponsoring the Ludwig Marx family who arrived in New York in March 1939, as well as Annie and Paul Elbert, Luise and Wilhelm Kretsch, and Hans Marx. They also attempted to sponsor the families of Otto Marx, Meinhard Marx, August Levi, and Felix Lichtenstein. On August 26, 1953, Lawrence B. Goldsmith, Jr. married Jewell Goldsmith (née Shelton, 1923-2009). Annie Schiffman died in 1959 and Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr. died in 1972. Robert Lee Schiffman (1888-1936), the only son of Isaak Schiffman, married Elsie Schiffman (1891-1976). They had a daughter Carolyn E. Schiffman (approx. 1922-?). After Robert’s death, Elsie Schiffman signed affidavits of support for several of his cousins and their families who were wanting to Nazi persecution in Germany.

Leo Schiffman Jr. married Lottie Wheelock Schiffman (née Gilbert, 1922-2004) in Providence, Rhode Island in 1950. They had two children, Robert F. Schiffman and Linda M. Hillis. Leo Schiffman Sr. died in Alabama in 1985. In Germany, Johanna Schiffmann married Heinrich Marx. They had several children. Following Johann Schiffmann’s death, Heinrich Marx married Sophie Eppstein and had additional children. Of the following Marx children, it is sometimes unclear if they were the children of Heinrich’s first or second marriage. Ludwig Marx (1887-1963) was born in Weinsheim at Bad Kreuznach on July 13, 1887. His wife Elizabeth Marx (Lissi, née Wälder, 1900-1983) was born in Münchweiler on August 18, 1900.

On June 30, 1937, Ludwig Marx wrote to his cousin Anne Goldsmith asking her to sponsor the family’s immigration to the United States. The Goldsmiths were initially reluctant to sponsor the Ludwig Marx family but in 1938 Lawrence Goldsmith agreed to sponsor the Ludwig Marx family so that they could in turn sponsor the rest of their family. The family arrived in New York in March 1939 aboard the RMS Aquitania. They stayed with family in New Rochelle, New York before securing a house of their own in New Rochelle.

Their son, Heinz Marx, was born on November 18, 1927. In March 1937, Otto wrote to his cousins Annie Goldsmith and Elsie Schiffman requesting assistance in immigrating to the United States. Lawrence Goldsmith was at first hesitant to expend support to Otto Marx and his family but on November 1938 an affidavit of support was signed and submitted for the family of three. The family attempted to immigrate to England and South America while awaiting their visas to the United States. However, the family was unable to leave Germany, despite assistance from the Goldsmiths. In late November or early December 1938, Otto Marx was hospitalized after being attacked by Nazi soldiers. Sometime in later 1941 or early 1942 the Marx family was arrested and deported to the Izbica ghetto in Poland.

Moritz requested affidavits of support for himself, Sarah, Helmut, and Greet from his cousin, Anne Goldsmith and her husband. They received United States visa but were unable to afford the cost of immigration. In 1942, Moritz and Suse were deported to Poland and around 1944 they were sent to the Izbica ghetto in Poland.

The Margaret Anne Goldsmith Hanaw collection contains correspondence between Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr., various members of the Schiffman and Marx families living in Germany, and United States government officials. The correspondence relates to the families’ requests for assistance in immigrating to the United States from Nazi Germany in the form of signed affidavits of support and financial assistance. The personal correspondence from the families in Germany provide a sense of growing desperation to leave Germany. Also included are Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr.’s papers relating his activity with the United Jewish Appeal in Alabama from 1939-1954, as well as documents relating to Oscar Goldsmith’s involvement in the American Jewish Relief Committee, 1917-1922. The collection includes family photographs as well as genealogy and research materials related to Jewish history in Alabama. The Margaret Anne Goldsmith Hanaw collection are arranged into five series. Series one, the American Jewish Relief Committee, 1917-1922, includes documents relating to the Oscar Goldsmith’s involvement in the American Jewish Relief Committee and payments to and from Mary Virginia McCormick. A hand written list of donations to the American Jewish Relief Committee is also included in the series. Series two, the United Jewish Appeal papers, 1939-1954, includes documents and correspondence created while Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr. served as chair of the Alabama United Jewish Appeal campaign. The series is organized into correspondence, financial materials, and printed materials. No materials from 1953 is included in this series. The correspondence largely relates to requests for and acknowledgements of financial donations. Some printed promotional materials can be found among the correspondence. The financial materials includes notes, lists of donations and amounts paid, receipts, the Constitution and By-Laws of Madison County Community Chest, bank deposit slips, check books, and account books. The printed materials include promotional materials and donation forms relating to various relief agencies, a newspaper clipping, and the publication “‘With my own eyes’ A Report on a Visit to Israel,” written and signed by Henry Morgenthau, Jr. Series three, Correspondence, 1884-1956, is organized into subseries which are arranged by family. The correspondence is written in German and English with occasional transcriptions of the German letters created by family members at the time. These transcriptions appear to be created for Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr. The correspondence is largely from extended family, cousins of Annie Goldsmith, who were seeking assistance in immigrating to the United States from Nazi Germany. In addition to letters, the correspondence includes telegrams, copies of signed affidavits of support, application instructions for immigration visas, other immigration documents, and shipping receipts for household goods. Correspondents with Annie Goldsmith and Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr. include the families of Ludwig Marx, Otto Marx, Moritz Marx, Meinhard Marx, Ella Lichtenstein, Sophie Levi, Paula Levi, Anny Elbert, Luise Kretsch, and Karl Heinz Marx. The letters from Germany reflect a sense of growing desperation on the part of the families to leave Nazi Germany. Series four, Jewish History in Alabama and the Margaret Anne Goldsmith Hanaw family genealogy, contains photocopies of newspaper clippings, magazine articles, and book chapters relating to Jewish history in Alabama. Also included are photocopies of photographs, family trees, and correspondence related to the genealogy of the Margaret Anne Goldsmith Hanaw family.

Some of these photographs were sent to Annie Goldsmith and Lawrence B. Goldsmith Sr. by family members in Germany as an incentive to assist the families wanting to flee Germany. The photographs are alluded to in the correspondence.
