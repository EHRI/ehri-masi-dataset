This fonds contains only the name of the people cancelled from the Judicial records-office, because they died or for other reasons, for a total of five thousand personal files. Among the so –called “subversives”, there were of course also Jews. Knowing the name of a Jewish person it is possible to find out whether he or she had ever been under surveillance, for a short period of time or for one’s entire life. Although Jews were not labelled as such, and Police did not look after them just because they were Jews, it is quite interesting to see what happened when the anti-Semitic laws came into force (1938).
