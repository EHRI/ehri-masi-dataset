15,448 records in 2 series; original bounded paper documents; partly digitalized.

This fonds is part of a collection of documents of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic KGB archive which has been transferred to the National Archive of Estonia, Estonian State Archive.

This archival fonds includes mostly cases of political repressions of the Soviet regime (1940-1941 and after 1944). A smaller part contains the interrogation materials of former guards and officials of the Concentration Camps, police and military personnel among Estonian residents who participated in or were accused of participating in Nazi crimes during the Second World War. 

The basic languages of the documents are Russian and Estonian; only a limited number of documents are in German (copied documents from the German occupation period) or other languages.
