Consists of three notebooks, handwritten by Irving Schaffer, circa March 1986, in which he wrote his memoir, which was published in 1991 as "Don't Give Up: Be Strong and We Will Meet Again." In the memoir, which is rough draft form, Mr. Schaffer describes his childhood in Kolochave, his deportation to Auschwitz in April 1944, his forced labor cleaning the site of the Warsaw ghetto, a forced march to Dachau and then sent to Landsberg. He was liberated by the American Army, describes life in the Feldafing displaced persons camp, and his emigration to the United States in 1947.
