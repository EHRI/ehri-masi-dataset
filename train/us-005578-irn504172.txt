The confessions of Franz Ziereis, the last commandant of Mauthausen consists of an English translation of the confession made by Ziereis after his arrest by American forces in May 1945. In the confession, Ziereis describes the persecution of Jews in Mauthausen, atrocities committed by SS guards, the Nazi practice of euthanasia, the use of human skin to bind books and make satchels, executions, death marches, a camp brothel, and camp inmate markings.
