Contains records of the Narodowe Sily Zbrojne (NSZ), a Polish military organization established in September 1942 as a union of some underground groups including Narodowy Zwiazek Wojskowy (National Military Union) and Zwiazek Jaszczurczy (The Lizard Union). One component of the NSZ joined the Armia Krajowa (Home Army) as a result of an agreement made on March 7, 1944; another component of the so-called Brygada Świętokrzyska (The Holy Cross Brigade) moved to Western Europe with German permission. Some groups of NSZ remained active after the war, fighting against the new Communist regime.
