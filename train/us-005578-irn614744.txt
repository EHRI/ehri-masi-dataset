Collection of correspondence between Isa (Elsa) Feri, in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Anna Miller (née Slotsky), in Waukegan, Illinois. Anna often travelled to Europe where she met Isa. Isa writes in October 1938 about being arrested for being Jewish; having to flee her home in Marienbad, Czechoslovakia; losing all her property; and asking for financial assistance and an affidavit of sponsorship so she and her fiancée can come to the United States. Includes a letter dated August 1940, from Gertrude Krumpl (friend of Isa Feri) to Anna Miller asking for affidavit “in place of the one for the wife of Mr. Kasnievsky, who meanwhile passed away.” Includes envelopes and translations.
