Documents related to the post-war experiences of Jacob Silvermintz (aka Jakob Silberminz), originally of Szkosin, Poland; issued while he was living as a displaced person in and around Munich, Germany, 1945-1949. Includes identification cards, including those certifying that he had previously been a prisoner at Buchenwald; residence permits; health documents; and letters of reference related to his apprenticeship as an auto mechanic at a number of German companies after 1945, including Robert Bosch, GmbH. Includes his typescript memoir, 71 pages, entitled "I'm Still Here: The Story of Jacob Silvermintz," c. 2001; in English, and completed by his children in 2011, after the onset of Alzheimers prevented him from finishing it. In the memoir, Silvermintz describes his childhood in Wloszczowa, Poland; the invasion of the Germans in 1939; his time as a forced labor, including his deportation to the Skarzysko-Kamienna camp in 1942, then to Buchenwald in late 1944, and then Berga an der Elster, from which he was evacuated in early 1945, shortly before being liberated by the Allies. He then describes his life as a displaced person, first in Italy, then in Germany, prior to his immigration to the United States in 1949, and his trip to Israel to find a bride, Hana, in 1956, and their subsequent life in New York.
