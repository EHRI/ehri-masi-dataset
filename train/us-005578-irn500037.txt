In the memoir, she describes life in the Riga ghetto, escaping several mass shootings, hiding her family's tallit, and being sent to Germany by boat in 1944. She witnessed the sinking of a barge of deportees, but her boat arrived in Stutthof. From there, she was forced to march to Totenhof in Sofienwald, and, in the spring of 1945, was sent on another forced march, from which she was liberated by the Russian Army. After the war, she reunited with her son, who also survived the war.
