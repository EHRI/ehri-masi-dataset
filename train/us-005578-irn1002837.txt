Liberation by Russians; crowds; Polish prisoners

Crowds of people waving and rejoicing as the Red Army troops enter the town. Troops marching prisoners (perhaps Polish) along a road outside the city, then cut back to the center of town. Lvov: more crowds of people, fists in the air, cheering the Soviet liberators. Men climb up onto tanks and throw pamphlets and newspapers at the crowd. The crowds lift the soldiers up onto their shoulders. Cut to a field with damaged vehicles, Polish prisoners laying on the ground, walking along a road. A band plays in the street. VS of an acrobat-contortionist and a clown performing for groups of soldiers. Soldier in a skirt. Translation: Begins with intertitle "Prisoners" then the words: "It's over. The game is done. Everything has turned into smoke and ashes. Like the souls from Dante's purgatory, these deceived people are making their way blindly, taking any path on the road. This is the end of swaggering words and ignoble deeds." "People on the street remember Mr. Beck, what a nimble sir he was!" "Mr (name unclear in narration) is walking on a street in Paris."
