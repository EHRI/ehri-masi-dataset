Paul Solomon Levie was born in Saarweilingen, Germany, on August 24, 1928, to Orthodox Jewish parents, Wladimar and Anna. He had a brother John. His father was also born in Saarweilingen where he worked in the animal trade. His mother, Anna Kahn, was born in Ilversheim. Paul and his parents were deported from Germany in 1941 to Gurs concentration camp in France. After six months, Paul was sent by the Quakers to the children's home in Aspet, France, where he remained for two years. He was given false papers in the name Paul Rudefleuve. He was later sent to Beaulieu (Moissac), France, and lived in different hiding places, including work camps in Toulouse. He was taken in by a man named Beppman who gave him a place to live in the children's home he supervised. When there was word that the Germans were plannig to round up Jews for deportation, Paul and the others were sent to a farm in the country to pick grapes. Paul remained in that area until the end of the war.

The papers consist of an identification card (Carte D'IdentiteÃÅ) issued under the false name of Paul Rudefleuve, a birth certificate under the same false name issued in the Departement du Haut-Rhin, and a photograph of Paul Levie in a children's home in Aspet, France.
