Adam Leczycki (born Abram Leczycki), was born on August 16, 1926 in Łódź, Poland. Following the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he was forced to move into the Jewish ghetto that was created in Łódź, and remained there until it was liquidated in August 1944. He was then taken as a prisoner to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and subsequently transferred to Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. After being liberated by the British Army at the latter camp in 1945, he returned to Poland. He immigrated to Israel in 1956, and later immigrated to the United States.

The collection contains prewar photographs of Adam Leczycki (born Abram Leczycki) and his family in Łódź, Poland, and postwar photographs of him in Israel.
