The Związek Literatów i Dziennikarzy Żydowskich w Polsce [Association of Jewish Writers and Journalists; Farajn fun Jidisze Literatn un Żurnalistn in Pojln] in Poland was one of the first Jewish institutions that was established in Lublin when it was liberated from Nazi occupation already in 1944. Among the founders were: Lejb Rochman, Jehuda Elberg, Efraim Siedlecki, Ruben Feldszuh, Grzegorz Jaszuński, Jehoszua Szlajen, Władek Godik and Jonas Turkow, who was appointed as chairman. Initially the Association was seated in Lódź, and then relocated to Warsaw. Its number never exceeded 50 members, with the vast majority having survived the war in the USSR. Anyone who published ten works in the Hebrew or Yiddish language, as well as authors of renowned books or translators of books that were at least 300 pages could become a member of the Association. About 23 volumes of poetry and prose were published by the end of 1949.

These materials contain information related to the pre-and-postwar life of individual persons. Also included are financial files, such as preliminary budgets, approved budgets and cash reports, as well as other financial documents.
