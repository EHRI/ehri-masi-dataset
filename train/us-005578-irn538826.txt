The Katz Ehrenthal Collection is a collection of more than 900 objects depicting Jews and antisemitic and anti-Jewish propaganda from the medieval to the modern era, in Europe, Russia, and the United States. The collection was amassed by Peter Ehrenthal, a Romanian Holocaust survivor, to document the pervasive history of anti-Jewish hatred in Western art, politics and popular culture. It includes crude folk art as well as pieces created by Europe's finest craftsmen, prints and periodical illustrations, posters, paintings, decorative art, and toys and everyday household items decorated with depictions of stereotypical Jewish figures.

Issue of La Libre Parole, a rabidly antisemitic and racist illustrated newspaper with the slogan "La France aux Français!" [France for the French!] published in France from 1892-1924. The cover illustration caption for this issue: "Les avatares de Simon dit Lockroy - Courtet." The newspaper was founded by the journalist Edouard Drumont, who claimed in an 1896 book, La France Juive [The French Jew] that Jews were responsible for everything that had gone wrong in France and were a threat to all good Frenchmen. Drumont was also a rabid anti-Dreyfusard. The journal quickly became very influential. In 1889, Drumont founded the Ligue Nationale antisémitique de France. He was elected to the national legislature in 1898. The newspaper is one of the more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of antisemitic artifacts and visual materials.
