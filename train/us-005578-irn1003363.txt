German victory at Kiev

"The Great Encirclement in the Ukraine" Map showing Kiev and surrounding areas, where a great German victory occurred on September 26, 1941. A triangle appears on the map around Kiev as the narrator describes the size of the area and the defeat and surrender of five Soviet armies. Footage of German soldiers and tanks taken during the "decisive hours of the battle." Quality somewhat grainy and contrast-y. Destruction, vehicles burning, burning oil in the streets. Masses of damaged war material. Troops and tanks moving across a field. German antiaircraft gunners aim and shoot down a Soviet plane, which we see fall from the sky and crash. The meeting of the Second Panzer Division, headed by General Heinz Guderian, and the army headed by General Paul von Kleist. Guderian is identified by name, speaking with someone who may be von Kleist. Shots of Soviets waving white flags as they surrender. The narrator reports that 656,000 Soviets prisoners taken. Columns of prisoners marching along the road. Close-ups of prisoners, identified by the narrator as uncivilized people from the Steppes of Asia who could have meant the end of European culture. Scenes of German soldiers, equipment, and vehicles moving "further forward, to the East" as the narrator announces that this was the greatest victory in history (it was in fact unprecedented in the scope of the defeat and the number of prisoners taken).
