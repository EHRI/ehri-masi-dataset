The first deposit (508/I) consists of correspondence and papers between Walter Gordon, a Jewish doctor from Hildesheim, Lower Saxony, and the authorities regarding his status and professional limitations in light of the anti-Semitic nazi laws. The provenance of this collection is unknown. These papers were not filmed in chronological order.</p><p> The second deposit (508/II) consists of 2 items: a printed list of non-aryan and â€˜<em>staatsfeindlich</em>' doctors and dentists in Nazi Germany, 1934; and a personal account of a German Jewish resident of Hamburg (cousin of the depositor), who emigrated to Shanghai in the 1930s. This material was donated by Mr Nelki in 1979.</p>
