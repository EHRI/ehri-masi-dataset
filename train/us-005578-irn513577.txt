Marcel (Mordechai, later Mark) Koller, the younger son of Israel (Susiu) Koller and Anna nee Haberman, was born on Apr. 23, 1931, in Vizhnitz in the Bukovina region of Romania. He has an older brother, Dov, born in 1937. In 1941, the Jews of Vizhnitz were deported to Transnistria, where the Koller family lived until 1942, when they received a Red Cross telegram from Anna's cousin in the United States, Morris Haberman, who assisted the family by sending food. The family was liberated by the Soviet Army on Apr. 23, 1944.

Collection consists of one album of photographs depicting the life of Mark Mordechai Koller and his family from 1931-1981. The collection also includes one report card, from Czernovitz (1945/1946) and one "Certificat de Calatorie", which is a group one-way passport from Romania to Israel (1949).
