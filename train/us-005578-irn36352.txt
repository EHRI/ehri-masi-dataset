United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of the German language memoir, written in 1983, of Elfriede Posner Greifinger, originally of Dziedzice, Poland, along with an English translation of the same completed by Mrs. Greifinger's daughter, Edith Millman. In the memoir, Mrs. Greifinger describes the outbreak of war in Warsaw, life in the Warsaw ghetto, the family's escape from the ghetto and life posing as Aryans and in hiding. The memoir, which was never finished, concludes as the family is being blackmailed about their secret. Also includes copies of photographs of Elfriede Greifinger, her sister, Erna Koch, and brother-in-law, Dollek Koch. Includes a copy of a postcard sent from Erna to her sister in 1943. Both Erna and Dollek perished in the Holocaust.
