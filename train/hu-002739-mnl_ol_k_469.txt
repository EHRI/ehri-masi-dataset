1 fasc., 0,01 linear metres

The personal files of former Prime Minister Döme Sztójay were acquired in 1948.

Döme Sztójay (1883-1946), politician, diplomat and soldier. Sztójay served as Hungarian ambassador in Nazi Germany between 1936 and 1944. Upon March 19, 1944, Horthy was to appoint him to be Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in the collaborationist government of Hungary. Sztójay held these function between March and August 1944 and was thus directly responsible for the mass deportations of close to half a million Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau during these months. He was sentenced to death and executed in 1946. The collection is a fragment of the semi-official correspondence of Döme Sztójay and mostly contains requests sent to him by private individuals.
