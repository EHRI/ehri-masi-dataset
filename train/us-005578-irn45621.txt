Schnurmann, who came from a family of shoemakers in Offenburg, Baden, fled Germany in 1939, settling in a Zionist youth community (kibbutz) in Svartingstorp, Sweden. He spent the war years there, corresponding with his parents, who resettled in Luxemburg, until their deportation and subsequent death in Theresienstadt in 1943. Following the war, Schnurmann emigrated to Israel, settling in Kibbutz Dafne, before his return to Offenburg, Germany in 1951. In 1992 he received the Bundesverdienstkreuz from the German government, and he died in Freiburg im Breisgau in 2004.

Contains approximately 26 letters and a photograph related to Schnurmann's stay at a Zionist youth kibbutz in Sweden, 1939-1945. Predominantly consists of correspondence from his parents, Elias and Rosa Schnurmann, but also from other family members and acquaintances in Sweden.
