Capture of partisans in Crimea

Waffen SS members search for partisans in the Crimea. Soldiers walk through wooded mountainous territory (at 1200 meters) in search of "Soviet soldiers in civilian clothes, Jews, and Soviet agents" who have allegedly been terrorizing the population. The Germans throw grenades and shoot at a stone and wood structure. They capture the "bandits," all in civilian dress. The narrator says that "these rabble can expect no mercy." The prisoners are led away by armed Germans.
