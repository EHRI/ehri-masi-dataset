Nazi propaganda text only poster, Das geht Dich an, deutsche Frau!! [This is for you, German Women!!] issued on December 4, 1939, for the Parole der Woche (Slogan of the Week) series. The poster reports an allleged British newspaper editorial explaining that the victory of Great Britain over Germany must be absolute. All German males must be killed, the German state and territory divided, and German women forced to marry other nationalities to destroy German racial purity. Parole der Woche was produced by the Nazi Party in Germany from 1936-1943. The series was discontinued in 1943 because of paper shortages caused by the prolonged war.
