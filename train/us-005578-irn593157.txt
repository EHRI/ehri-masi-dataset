Rada Główna Opiekuńcza (Central Welfare Council) RGO-Polish social welfare organization, established in February 1940, with the consent of the German occupation authorities, for the assistance of the Polish population residing in the General Gouvernement. RGO's activities included the distribution of food, clothing and cash benefits to the most deprived, running of folk kitchens, shelters, nursing homes and guest houses, parcel shipments for prisoners, and special relief actions for displaced from the territories annexed to the Third Reich, displaced from the Zamość region, and of Warsaw - after the end of the Warsaw Uprising. RGO operated through a network of care councils and their delegations, established in individual districts, counties and cities. It is estimated that the RGO helped an average of 800,000 people every year until 1944. The Council was headed by prince Janusz Radziwiłł (until June 1940), count Adam Ronikier (until October 1943) and Konstanty Tchórznicki (until April 1945). The Council had at least 15 000 volunteers all around Poland. The Council received finances from the German authorities and (clandestinely) from the Polish Government in Exile.
