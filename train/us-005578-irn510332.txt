1

Dr. Blanche Krakowski was born in August 5, 1936 in Paris, France. Her father and brother were rounded up in 1941, and deported to Drancy and possibly Beaune-la-Rolande. They did not survive the Holocaust. Blanche and her mother survived the war by moving from house to house. Blanche remembered one time when the French police arrived at their house her mother beg the police to leave them alone, and they did. Her mother remarried another survivor after the war, although Blanche states it was more out of convenience and “not a happy union.” The family immigrated to the United States in 1953. Her mother worked as a seamstress and eventually established her own business creating household items like drapes and slipcovers, etc.

The Krakowski family papers consists of one letter (in fragments) from Beaune La Rolande concentration camp, two photographs taken while in hiding on a farm, and six pre-war photographs of the the Krawkowski family.
