Eliezer Löwi was born Leszek Löwi in Lʹvov, Poland (now Lʹviv, Ukraine), on Apr. 14, 1938, to Nachman and Mina Löwi. His uncle, Mayer Löwi, smuggled Eliezer out of the Janowska work camp during the summer of 1941 and took him to the Jashchemski family's farm in Zohorowice where he was hidden until 1944. After the end of World War II, he and his mother lived in Belgium until 1949 when they emigrated to Israel.

The photographs depict Eliezer Löwi's experiences after World War II in Belgium and Israel. The images consist of mostly portrait photographs of Eliezer Löwi as a young boy, at his Bar Mitzvah, and as a member of the Israeli Navy. Also included are a photograph of Mr. Löwi and his mother in Israel and a class portrait of schoolchildren in Antwerp, Belgium.
