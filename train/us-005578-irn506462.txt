Mania Rosenberg (née Rosenberg; 1911-) of Kielce, Poland was the daughter of Oodle and Abraham Rosenberg. She moved to Łódź as a child, and married her uncle Jacob Rosenberg around 1936. They had two children, Ada (later Ada Gracin; 1936-) and Abraham (1940-). Jacob joined the Polish army after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, and soon left Łódź for an area near the Polish-Russian border. Mania and Ada left Łódź in the winter to join Jacob in Russia. From there they went to Kutaisi, Georgia where Abraham was born. They remained in Kutaisi until the end of the war. After the war, they returned to Łódź, but after finding their apartment occupied, they decided to leave Poland. The family soon left for Germany and ended up at the Feldafing displaced persons camp, where they remained from 1945-1949. They immigrated to the United States in March 1949 on board the U.S.S. General W. M. Black, and settled in New York.

The collection documents the post-war experiences of the Rosenberg family in the Feldafing displaced persons camp. Included are photographs depicting the lives of Mania and Jacob Rosenberg and their children Ada and Abraham in the camp; Jacob’s cousin Harry Silverman at the Lemberg displaced persons camp; childrens’ religious classes; and a wedding. Other material includes Mania Rosenberg's identification card from Feldafing, a newspaper article written by Jacob Rosenberg and published in Feldafing, and a Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) greeting card for 1947.
