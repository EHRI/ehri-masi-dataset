1 electronic resource (4 pages)

The file contains a report of the German Embassy of Kopenhagen to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin dated 26.05.1933 regarding anti –German agitation and propaganda in Denmark. Anti-German agitation can only be found in the press, it expresses public opinion, mainly against German economic policy (customs duties), persecution of Jews and burning of books in Germany. Intervention of the German embassy against pro-Polish propaganda in radio broadcasting, now all talks about foreign policy in radio are under censorship of the Foreign Ministry. The different branches of Danish press are described and their international network. French Propaganda is hardly influential. There is some Polish Propaganda, mainly financed by the Polish Embassy. England agitates with considerable success against Germany in the economic field. Although there is close contact between German and Danish Social Democrats, there is hardly any anti-German influence from Germany traceable. There was successful protest at the Danish Government against harsh language used by the Danish left-wing press. The German Embassy educates mostly orally and through the press, sometimes by spreading literature. It gets is material partly from the Foreign Ministry, partly from the German Press and in some cases from Dr. Johansen. A considerable extension of the counter-propaganda does not seem suitable.
