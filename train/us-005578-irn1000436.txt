German soldiers advance; Jewish forced to dig a pit

The German military enters Riga, Latvia: jeeps (some full of soldiers, some pulling ammunition) drive through cobblestoned city streets. Views of destruction all around: bodies and dead horses, rubble, shattered buildings. A sense of grim, utter destruction pervades. Pan of the bombed-out facades ending at an artist sitting in the street, sketching the sight. 03:28:15 At Ku≈æiai forest (15km from Siauliai, Lithuania) rounded-up Jews, many in suits, some bearded and in religious garb, jump off the back of an open truck, shovels in hand. They are made to dig in field/orchard, then move large rocks, under supervision of German soldier, who struts and shouts commands. Medium CU of men taking off their shirts. Strong sense of fear, intimidation. (the Jews from Siauliai are later murdered and buried in this pit on June 28, 1941)
