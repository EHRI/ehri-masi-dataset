Contains letters and postcards sent by Josel and Sheine Katz (donor’s paternal grandparents) in Naumiestis, Lithuania, to their sons Eliahu Arie Katz and Louis Katz (donor's father), in the United States. Also includes correspondence from Louis’s siblings, Zlata, Mendel and Enoch, to their brother and his family. The last postcard was written on March 16, 1943, by the youngest sister of Louis Katz, Rivka (or Riva) Katz, who was in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan; Rivka was the only member of the family in Lithuania who survived, and she joined her brother in the United States in 1948.
