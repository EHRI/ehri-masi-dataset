Hitler becomes chancellor

Both daytime and nighttime scenes. Daylight scenes are good. Title: "Hindenburg and Hitler at the window of the Reichschancellery." Spotlit Nazi flags passing by. Hindenburg appears at the window, dimly lit from a lamp or candles behind him. SA men bearing torches run in formation. Hitler, spotlit at the window, salutes the crowd below. A brief closer view of Hitler at the window.
