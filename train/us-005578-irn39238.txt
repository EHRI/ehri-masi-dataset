Consists of 12 photographs taken in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp of David Frankel (born Towia Frenkiel) and Lili Frydman (later Frankel), and their son, Abraham Frankel. Includes photographs of their wedding on May 19, 1946 in the displaced persons camp, the Frankels with groups of friends, and a photograph labeled 1940, which the donor believes to be a photograph of a crematorium at Auschwitz, circa 1940, which Lili Frankel obtained from an unknown source.
