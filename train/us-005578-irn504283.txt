Helen Fein is the executive director of the Institute for the Study of Genocide, based in New York.

Helen Fein's essay, which she presented to the "Les genocides" conference in Paris (08-10 December 1989), "Genocide as the Nazi Locomotive of History: Trains of Boxed Victims," attempts to prove that the Holocaust should be "understood in the context of Nazi ideology and German war goals" and that "genocide was the ultimately defining program and strategy of Nazi Germany." To demonstrate the correctness of her hypotheses, Fein's essay discusses Nazi antisemitism and members of the party's attitudes about gays, people of Slavs, and Roma.
