Consists of the unfinished handwritten memoirs of Leon Matsas, entitled "Survival I," "Survival II," and Survival III." The memoirs are originally written in Greek and have been translated by Mr. Matsas' daughter, Ninetta Matsa Feldman. In the memoirs, Mr. Matsas, a banker, describes pre-war antisemitism and the fear of a German invasion. In 1940, he transferred with his family from Preveza to Agrinion, and after the war began, to Ioannina (Janina or Yanina). He describes life in the Greek Army, into which he was drafted to fight against the Italians in Albania; as well as the Army's retreat in April 1941; and the German invasion of Greece. He was reunited with his family and they returned to Agrinion. They began to receive warnings about deportations and, with the assistance of the local underground, began to think of leaving for the mountains. Though this is the conclusion of his written testimony, Mr. Matsas also includes the story of a childhood friend, Leon Levi, who was briefly imprisoned in a concentration camp in Thebes.
