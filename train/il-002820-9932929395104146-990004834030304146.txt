1 electronic resource (30 pages)

The file contains a report of January 1937 about the position of Jews in Germany. The report has appeared in English, German and French and was published by the Jewish Central information Office, which published every month a new report always regarding the situation of Jews in Germany or other European countries. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). In January 1937 new laws and boycott actions in German small and medium towns started. For example the boycott of Jewish businesses, prohibitation of Jewish gathering was announced, this ban was intended to be regarded as a reprisal against the reports which had appeared in the foreign press in connection with the trial of David Frankfurter at Chur of the forthcoming anti-Jewish measures of the Gestapo and also the 'Ring, Bund Juedischer Jugend' was dissolved by the Gestapo. The general social and economic situation for Jews in Germany has been explained in detail in this report as well. Furthermore new notifications for factories, shops, businesses and employers regarding the handling of Jews can be seen.
