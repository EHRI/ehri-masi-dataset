Contains a testimony, 142 pages, photocopy of typescript, describing the author's account of being a woman in a concentration camp in Vienna for four months. In the preface, written in 1939, she says events are true but she changed names to protect people who may still be imprisoned. Includes an article from a U.S. newspaper describing Max Niedermeier and his daughter Maria, and alludes to his unnamed wife (likely the testimony author) who spent 4 months in prison in Vienna, while he was imprisoned for 2 months.
