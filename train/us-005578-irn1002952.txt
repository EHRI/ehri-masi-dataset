Ostarbeiter games

Excerpts from the fifth story of the newsreel "German Weekly Review" No. 624 for 1943 about sports competitions between workers from different countries who came to work in Germany. Several shots of different groups of people on a field, each with a sign indicating their nationality: Protektorat, Kroaten, Franzosen, Belgier, Hollander, Ostarbeiter, Italiener, Bulgaren, Ostarbeiter. The narration indicates that these are work teams living and working in Germany. They go on to engage in athletic competitions, including tug of war, a track race, and a soccer game (France vs. Protektorat, France wins). Translation of Ukrainian narration: A sport festival took place in [a German city, name not audible] among European work teams whose members work in Germany. Race. National teams. And the winner is France. A soccer match between France and the Protectorate. The French are wearing bright shirts. And the French team wins 2 to 1.
