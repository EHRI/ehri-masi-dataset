United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of one memoir, entitled "Journey to Survival," by Ninetta Matsa Feldman, originally of Arta, Greece. In the memoir, she recalls watching her father leave briefly for the Greek Army; and wartime life in Agrinio, Greece. In the fall of 1943, her family went into hiding in the small mountain town of Psilovrahos, where they remained for a year, at one point hiding in a cave from a German raid. After the war ended in Greece and the family returned to Agrinio, they learned that the Jews of Ioannina were deported on March 25, 1944, and that only a handful of their family living in Greece survived the Holocaust.
