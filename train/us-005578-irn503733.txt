Consists of three letters, one written by Sally Meyer and two written by Theo Seyock. The Sally Meyer letter describes the decaying situation for him and his family in Germany. That letter was entrusted to Theo Seyock, who promised to deliver it to relatives of Meyer in the United States. The two letters from Seyock describe his attempts to fulfill that promise. The 14 January 1948 letter from Seyock also describes his supervision of a Wehrmacht vehicle repair depot, where he became acquainted with Sally Meyer. He states that he was in charge of about 80 Jewish laborers from the concentration camp near Riga. Sally Meyer was among the concentration camp prisoners that Seyock supervised.
