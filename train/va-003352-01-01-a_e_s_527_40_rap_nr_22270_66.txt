Le nonce Ã  Rio de Janeiro Aloisi Masella au cardinal Maglione

Aloisi Masella informs Maglione about the requirements in order to grant a visa to non-Aryan German Catholics, namely about the amount to be paid, which is 20 000 pounds (and not 20 000 golden pounds). This pecuniary contribution may also be waived.
