Albert M. Sharon (1924-1990) was born into a Jewish household in Warsaw, Poland before moving to Brussels, Belgium as a child. In 1940, when Albert was 15 years old, the Germans invaded Belgium. Albert, along with his two sisters and one brother, fled with his parents to France in order to escape the fighting. The family moved between several different villages in the south of France, along the Pyrenees. In Toulouse, Albert and his brother aided in forging documents for the underground resistance, and were eventually imprisoned in Lyons, France. Once reuniting with his family, he traveled to Italy after the armistice was signed. Albert had his story transcribed by his wife, Lynn Sharon, months before his passing in 1990.
