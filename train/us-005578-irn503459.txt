Emil Beamt was born on 12 Dec. 1898 and served as the president of the Jewish community of Prostějov, Czechoslovakia, until his deportation to Theresienstadt in 1942. He was transported to Auschwitz on 28 Sept. 1944 and never returned. Erich Beamt is presumably the brother of Emil Beamt.

Consists of copies of letters written by Erich Beamt and his brother, Emil Beamt, president of the Jewish community of Prostějov, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), during the period from 1939 to 1942. The letters describe the sorrows and anxiety felt by the Beamt family members as they witnessed the Nazi advance during the early years of World War II and the family's strong desire to emigrate to Canada, the United States, or South America before their deportation.
