Consists of one typed memoir entitled "Zug Bist Ahtzen" ["Say You're Eighteen"] as told by Auschwitz survivor Gary S. Rubinstein to his grandson, Benyamin Moalem. In the memoir, Mr. Rubinstein describes the German invasion of his hometown of Wołomin, Poland. He describes being placed in a ghetto and his attempted escape to Łomża, Poland, in the fall of 1942. Almost immediately upon his arrival, the Jews of Lomza were marched to Zambrów , and, six weeks later, deported to Auschwitz. He was assigned to Kanada, where he sorted prisoner belongings and describes both the Nazi officers smuggling valuables and the ways in which members of the commando would try to inform and save incoming prisoners by lying about their ages. In January 1945, he managed to escape from the death march and hid in the barn of a Polish woman. After the war, Mr. Rubinstein reunited with his parents and two of his four siblings, who had also survived. He emigrated to the United States in March 1948.
