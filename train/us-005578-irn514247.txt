Dora Goldstein Roth was born in 1932, in Warsaw, Poland. After the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, Dora's family fled to Vilna (Vilnius), Lithuania. When the Germans occupied Vilna, Dora's father was shot, and the rest of the family was confined in the Vilna ghetto. Dora, her sister, and her mother were deported to the Kaiserwald concentration camp in Latvia and then to the Stutthof concentration camp near Danzig (Gdansk), Poland. Her mother and sister perished in Stutthof. Dora was shot immediately before liberation, but she survived.
