Consists of one memoir, 28 pages, entitled "The Story of my Life" by Berta Rosenblatt Berlin, originally of a small town near Buczacz, Poland. In the memoir, written in July 1974, Mrs. Berlin describes the family's move to Vienna during World War I, her marriage to Hersh Berlin, and the anti-Jewish persecution in Vienna after the Anschluss. After Kristallnacht, the Berlin family was able to reunite in Belgium, as Mr. Berlin, then their son Kurt, and finally Berta Berlin, were able to escape Vienna. The family immigrated to the United States through France, Spain, and Portugal in 1940 and 1941, finally arriving in New York in June 1941. She also describes the experiences of her extended family, both during and after the Holocaust.
