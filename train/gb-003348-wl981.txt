Abraham family: Copy correspondence

2 folders

The Abraham family had lived in Berlin for generations. The father Leopold, a plumber by trade, and his wife Frieda were deported to Theresienstadt some time in 1943, never to be seen again. Max, the son, came to England with his wife, Hanni, in 1939, where he worked as a technical teacher at the ORT school in Leeds<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>. He had previously worked as a technical teacher in the ORT school in Berlin. Hanni's parents and brother and sister all perished in Auschwitz. Frank Russell, one of the correspondents in the later letters, was an ex pupil of the ORT school in Leeds.

The copy correspondence in this collection documents the experiences of a German Jewish family in Berlin and England.
