boxes

773

Consists of 773 boxes containing inactive case files of Jewish Holocaust survivors who claimed restitution for suffering and damage resulting from persecution by the Nazis during the period 1933 to 1945. The records are divided into five major groups. First, there are the records tilted "BEG" (Bundes-EntschaÌˆdigungs-Gesetz or Federal Compensation/Restitution Law). The BEG files contain one-time-only claims. For the most part, these are copies. The originals are in Germany. Second, there are the records titled "URO." These files contain general claims for restitution. Third, there are the cases titled "Jewelry." These concern claims of restitution relating to stolen jewelry. Fourth, there are the files titled "Hungary." These cases deal only with Jews born in Hungary and persecuted in Hungary or elsewhere, either by Germans or Hungarian collaborators. Fifth, there are the records titled Austria. These cases deal with Austrian-born Jews, who were persecuted by the Germans in Austria or elsewhere. In general, the Toronto URO files concern life in Nazi-occupied Europe, life in concentration camps, and experiences of survivors during and after the Holocaust. Among the documents are sworn testimonies of witnesses, indemnity claims, correspondence with doctors and lawyers, medical reports, and memoirs. *Not available on microform.
