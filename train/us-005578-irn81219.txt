Walter Kamlet was born in Berlin, Germany, on October 22, 1922, to Benno and Mila Kamlet. He had a younger brother, Manfred. Benno Kamlet owned a sporting goods store in Berlin. During the war, the family moved to Belgium where Benno and Mila survived the Holocaust in hiding while Walter and Manfred were placed in a children’s home. In May 1940, the children's home was evacuated to France, ending up at Château de la Hille, near the Spanish border. Walter was a skilled musician and played concerts for the other children at la Hille, and received treatment for tuberculosis. In April 1944, he and Manfred escaped into Switzerland, as did Manfred. Walter remained in Switzerland for the rest of his life, living with his companion, Christa Salanthe.

Consists of original pre-war, wartime, and post-war documents, restitution paperwork, and photographs related to the life and Holocaust experiences of Walter Kamlet, originally of Berlin, Germany. The collection includes information regarding Kamlet's life as a teenager at the Château de la Hille children's home run by the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE), as well as a large number of photographs of the other children in the home, and documents regarding his escape into Switzerland in April 1944.
