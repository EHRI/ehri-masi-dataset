Saur, 1988, p. 46.

The correspondence concerns various administrative, financial, and mostly historical aspects, i.e. those related to the Nazi persecution of the Jews. Particular reference deserves the discussion of a draft of a new constitution for The Wiener Library (1948-49). Beside several handwritten letters by Breslauer the correspondence contains on letter in Dutch language.
