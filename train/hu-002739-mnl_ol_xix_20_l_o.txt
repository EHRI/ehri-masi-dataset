The records on compensation programs that were implemented to help Hungarian survivors of the Holocaust are from the years 1946 to 1998 with the bulk of the materials concerning 1957 to 1975, the main period of compensation programs run by West Germany when agencies and individuals in communist Hungary would already be among their recipients. The various documents in the collection include notes and minutes, circulars and internal exchanges of relevant official Hungarian bodies. There are also the documents that supported Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish claims, including individual claim sheets, completed questionnaires that were meant to summarize experiences of the Holocaust, both of survivors and their deceased relatives, statistical surveys, and materials on the distribution of the compensation that was eventually made available by the Federal Republic of Germany. Moreover, the collection includes the correspondence between Hungarian organs and various German authorities, organizations, and companies. There are also financial and administrative documents and correspondence items of both the Germany Federal Compensation Law and the Germany Federal Restitution Law programs that are relevant for the study of compensation in Hungary. Last but not least, there is documentation of Austrian compensation measures such as administrative papers, claims and correspondence.
