Sobibor Interviews 1983-1984, interview 12, Arkady Wajspapir

Interview with Arkady Wajspapir (1921). Wajspapir served as a sergeant in the Red Army and was injured in September 1941. As a Jewish prisoner of war he and the other Soviet soldiers had to build barracks in Lager IV in Sobibor. It quickly dawned on him that 'the only way out of there was to escape'. Before he was drafted into the Red Army Arkady Wajspapir worked as an engineer. After his recovery in a field hospital in Kiev he was transported to Minsk as a POW. On 22 September 1943 he, Pechersky and other soldiers, arrived in Sobibor. After the war he returned to his old profession of engineer in the town of Donetzk.
