Gerede, Turkish Ambassador, at Reichs Chancellery

A car arrives in the interior courtyard of the Reichs Chancellery and the new Turkish ambassador in Berlin, Ambassador Husrev Gerede, gets out of the car. The narration says that he will be received by Hitler but this meeting is not shown. Gerede greets two officials on the steps of the Chancellery and enters the building. Very dark interior shot of the building. Gerede emerges from the Chancellery and shakes hands with Nazi officials before departing. Shot of SS men with rifles standing at attention. Another brief shot of Gerede getting into his car.
