Her family resided in Chrzanów, Poland. In February 1943 Chana was deported to the Bernsdorf subcamp of Gross-Rosen. She was liberated in May 1945 and went to the Landsberg displaced persons camp. Chana immigrated to the United States in 1946 aboard the SS Marine Perch. She married Wilford Wittenberg in 1949. Her family perished during the Holocaust.

The collection primarily consists of post-war photographs related to Ann Wittenberg (born Chana Moszkowicz in Chrzanów, Poland) and others in the Landsberg displaced persons camp. Also included is a 1988 copy of her Polish birth certificate.
