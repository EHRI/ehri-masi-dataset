From 1942 until her liberation, Louise stayed in a small chamber under the roof of the house and was supplied food by friends. Louise married David Schneider in Antwerp, Belgium on May 28, 1946 and had a son, Robert Schneider, the following year in 1947. The family immigrated to the United States in 1956 on the SS Mauritania and was naturalized in New York before moving to Miami Beach, Florida.
