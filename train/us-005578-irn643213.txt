Lotte Seligmann (1912-1994) was born on 1 January 1912 in Marsberg, Germany to Adolf (b. 1878) and Emma (née Weitzenkorn, b. 1883). She had one brother, Siegbert (1909-1965). Her father worked as a cattle dealer in Marsberg. Lotte studied to become a nurse, and worked in Frankfurt am Main from 1931-1937. On 16 November 1938 she and her parents immigrated to the United States via Hamburg. Lotte married Henry Barak in August 1946. Henry (born Heinrich, 1913-1986) was the son of Marcus (1882-1935?) and Ida Eva Barak (née Fuchs, b. 1882). He had one brother, Joseph (1906-1995) and one sister, Klara (b. 1910). His parents met in England, but later moved to Vienna, Austria. Joseph emigrated from Austria to the United States in 1927 and Henry followed him in 1933. He trained as a furrier and served in the United States Army during World War II. They had one daughter, Eve. Both Henry’s mother and sister perished during the Holocaust, likely at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Lotte’s brother Siegbert immigrated to the U.S. in the 1930s and opened a factory in New York. He married Kay Reiss and they had one daughter, Carol Lynn.
