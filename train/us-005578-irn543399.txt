folder

1

Contains a letter received by Leon Hilersberg from the American Consulate, dated 20 May 1938, in Vienna, Austria. The letter informs the recipient that all documents submitted to emigrate to the United States are satisfactory. The Polish quota, nevertheless, is filled and they will have to wait for at least six months and their names are on the waiting list and will be informed by the embassy as soon as an opening is available. On the bottom of the letter is a note (in English) from the American Vice-Consulate stating that any visas for other countries would not affect the family's place in the U.S. waiting list. The collection also contains German passports for Leon and Henryka Hillersberg, each of which bears an immigration visa for the United States given in Havana, Cuba, April 3, 1940.
