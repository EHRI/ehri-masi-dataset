During the fascist period, trade-unions freedom had been abolished: only corporative syndicates (protecting a specific workers’ category) were allowed to operate (law n° 563, issued in 1926). This kind of syndicates were legally responsible for all the workers, even though they were not formally enrolled in. Italian government could watch over syndicates’ leaders, and also remove them. This fonds contains acts of the Mantua District Union of Professional people and Artists, that was part of the National Confederation of Fascist Syndicates.
