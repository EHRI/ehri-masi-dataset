After the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, Anna was no longer able to attend school, and the family was forced to move. In June 1944 Dezső was deported to a forced-labor camp. Anna and her mother went into hiding and moved several times to avoid deportation to a concentration camp. Anna immigrated to the United States in 1956 and settled in Madison, Wisconsin. Her parents immigrated to the United States by 1962. Anna married Andre Blum and they had two children, Ronald and Leah.
