David Eizenberg was born in 1911 in eastern Poland (now Ukraine) and immigrated to the United States at age 11. During World War II, he trained at Camp Ritchie, and, in his role as a technical sergeant, set up communications for, among other events, the Potsdam Conference. After the war, he worked for the Joint Distribution Committee and HIAS in displaced persons camps and accompanied the children going to Palestine on the ship Champollion. While assisting displaced persons searching for relatives, he met Lisa Egler (b. May 19, 1924). She was half-Jewish and had been active in the Red Orchestra. The couple later married.
