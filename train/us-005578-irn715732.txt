Memorial for those martyred in Poland

Contains a leaflet entitled (in translation) "Memorial for those martyred in Poland during the months Tamuz to Kislev 1942-1943" (Hebrew). No publisher or year is indicated, though publication was possibly in Palestine circa 1943. Contains a version of the "El Maleh Rachamim" (God Full of Mercy) prayer in memory of Holocaust victims, presumably written during or after the Operation Reinhard deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto. Translation of the prayer (at least in part): "The thousands upon thousands souls of Israel … that were killed … in the countries occupied by the Nazis … Poland, Austria, Bulgaria, Belgoium, Bukovina, Servia, Galicia, Germany, Denmark, Holland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Czechoslovakia, France, Occupied Russia, and the other countries occupied by the enemy" (Hebrew).
