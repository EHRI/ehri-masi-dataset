Verfilmungsprojekt "Die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion"

1 electronis ressource (73 pages)

This file contains 73 pages including multiple documents that are part of a project that was started in 1991 by the School of the Swiss Federal Polytechnic (ETH Zurich). After the fall of the USSR the public found out about a giant archive in Moscow that had original and duplicates of documents from the Bern trials and the Protocols. Now the goal of the project was to convert all the documents about the Bern trials and the Protocols of the elder of Zion into microfilms. This file contains several of those documents including duplications of multiple court files from 1932 to 1936.
