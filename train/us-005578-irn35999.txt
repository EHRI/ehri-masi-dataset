Consists of one memoir, 250 pages, entitled "Deeper Into the Forest," written in 1989 by Stanislaw Kalwinski, originally of Ho≈Çosko, near Lwow, Poland. Mr. Kalwinski recalls his family's history and childhood memories, including his memory of the German invasion of Poland and the subsequent Russian occupation of the area. In the summer of 1942, the family decided to hide Jews in their basement; they eventually saved 23 Jews, including Leon Wells. Mr. Kalwinski, a child at the time, describes the people they hid and how they hid them. In 1944, after accidentally almost revealing the secret, he went to Trzciana and spent the rest of the war there before reuniting with his family. In 1946, the family moved to Gliwice. Mr. Kalwinski immigrated to the United States in 1962.
