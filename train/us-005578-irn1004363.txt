Invasion of Poland

German soldiers lift the barrier between Germany and Poland as they invade the country. The narrator says: "So one eliminates borders that the hate-apostles of Versailles imagine can separate the German people from the German Reich." More shots of the barrier being pushed aside. Motorcycles with sidecars carrying German soldiers speed toward the camera and turn off the road. This is accompanied by fast-paced music and the sounds of gunfire. Soldiers sheltering behind trees, riding by on horseback, setting up a howitzer. Wide shot of a large field filled with tanks and trucks. A tank bearing a white cross rolls by as one of the occupants grins up at the camera. German soldiers on horse-drawn carts are greeted by waving ethnic Germans (presumably). Well-known shot of a line Germans in motorcycles with sidecars diverging at a fork in the road with a sign in the foreground that says something about the town of Bydgoszcz.
