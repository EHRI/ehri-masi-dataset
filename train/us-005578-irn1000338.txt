Deportation of Bessarabian Jews to Transnistria

Low aerial shots from a plane show the destroyed city of Balti. Pan across dead bodies, with the narration that the KPU and their "Jewish helpers" had perpetrated the murders. The next shot shows the forced march of Bessarabian Jews in the area of Balti, Romania, part of the deportations to Transnistria, late fall, 1941. The narration describes how these "eastern Jewish types" overran Europe after the World War I and attempted to destroy the culture of the non-Jews. Long line of impoverished people moving along a country road and over a low wooden bridge. Some are barefoot. Most carry bundles. They are guarded by a few Romanian soldiers. Pan of a seemingly endless line of people stretching back to the horizon.
