Consists of a photograph album depicting German-occupied Poland, primarily Warsaw. The album was likely compiled and captioned by Jakob Lechner, an Austrian SS Hauptsturmführer who served as a Kriminal-Kommissar in Warsaw. While many photographs are attributed to propaganda photographer Mieczysław Bil-Bilażewski, personal snapshots are included. The album features events celebrating German occupiers, the reception of the Japanese delegation at Malkinia, and propaganda photography of the Warsaw ghetto. Among the figures depicted are Governor-General Hans Frank, Governor of Krakow Otto Wächter, and Higher SS and Police Leader Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger. The collection also contains loose photographs of the exterior and interior of the West End Synagogue in Frankfurt, Germany.
