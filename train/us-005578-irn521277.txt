Shmaryagu Shargel (1927-2013) was born on 15 May 1927 in Janów neighborhood of Tarnopol, Poland (Ternopil, Ukraine) to Naftaly and Rosa Shargel. During the Holocaust, his wife Riva Shargel’s family was in a camp, possibly Bor, from 1942-1944. Reila Aizenberg served on the front throughout the war. Lazarus Mesyo (1916-1941) was tortured by Ukrainians in 1941. Shmaryagu’s father Naftaly was murdered by the Nazis in the Trembowla ghetto.

There is also a post-war photograph of Shmaryagu with his family visiting the graves of Jews murdered in the Trembowla ghetto.
