United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Margaret Klug (née Grete Jastrow) was born on June 8, 1923, in Posen, Germany (now Poznaân, Poland). She was jailed in Berlin, Germany, and the day before her assigned transport left for the Auschwitz concentration camp, she jumped out of a window and was taken to a hospital in Berlin for nine months. She was transported to Auschwitz and shortly after was sent to Czechoslovakia. After liberation she returned to Berlin where she met her husband, Solomon. The two immigrated to Israel where they stayed for four years. Margaret and her husband then went to Nuremberg, Germany, where they stayed for one year in a displaced persons camp. In 1955, the Klugs came to the United States and settled in Atlanta.

The collection consists of 30 original and copy photographs of Margaret Jastrow Klug's extended family both before and after World War II.
