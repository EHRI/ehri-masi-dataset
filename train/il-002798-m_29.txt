In this section, only files from the 1920s until the end of World War II regarding Jews and the persecution of Jews are checked;- The NS Section is which the documentation regarding the Nazi party institutions and organizations and the State Institutions that were unique to the Third Reich (such as the RSHA) is concentrated.
