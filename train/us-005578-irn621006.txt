I'm An American Day 1941 -- Fiorello LaGuardia

On May 18, 1941 at 4:00PM, New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia hosted I’m An American Day on the Mall in New York City’s Central Park. The jubilant mayor goes on to introduce COL “Fighting” Phil Donovan to the thousands of citizens gathered in celebration. COL Donovan explains to native-born citizens why they should be proud to be Americans. He points out eating breakfast, assuming public school is competent and free thought as daily activities that are taken for granted. COL Donovan states Americans are privileged to look forward to the future without fear. The decorated veterans warns America is in danger because of the war happening in Europe. He adds modern warfare can happen spiritually. Therefore, Americans need to be prepared mentally and spiritually to do what is necessary. I’m An American Day ends with Rabbi Stephen Wise reading a scripture.
