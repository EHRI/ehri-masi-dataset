Consists of a memoir entitled "The Silent Story of Those Children" by Rosette Kleinmann Lissek, who was born in Paris in 1940 and survived the war in hiding in various places. Rosette's father was interned in a number of French internment camps, while Rosette, her mother, and her younger sister Jeanine (born 1942) hid in France and Belgium with the help of OSE. After the war, the family immigrated briefly to Israel, then back to Europe before leaving for Bolivia, and ultimately, to Argentina in 1951. Also includes copies of family photographs and documents. Copies of the memoir exist in English and in French.
