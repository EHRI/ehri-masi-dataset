Prefettura di Mantova. Ufficio di Gabinetto. Fondo riservato

10 folders

This fonds contains acts of the Mantua Prefecture that were considered “confidential”, due to their “delicacy”. In the folder of the year 1961 there are three copies of the circular letter n° 30, issued by “Ministero dell’Interno” (the Home Secretary of the Italian Government) in June 1961, asking for the deposit into the Italian State Archives of all the documents related to the racial persecution of the “citizens of Jewish origin”, that were still kept by the local “Questura” (Police-headquarters) or “Prefettura” (Prefecture). Documents requested are not only personal files, but also general ones, linked to the racial campaign; the only ones excluded are the files of the German concentration camps, as some Jewish people still need them in order to ask compensation from the Federal Government of Bonn. Both “questore” (the head of Police-headquarters) and “prefetto” (the head of Prefecture) of Mantua claim that there are no documents related to the Jews in their archives (June-August 1961).
