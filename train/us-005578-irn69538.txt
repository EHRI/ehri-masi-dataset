Consists of one memoir, 59 pages, entitled “Lost and Waiting to be Found,” written by Jackie (Jacky) Young (born Jona Spiegel), originally of Vienna, Austria. In the memoir, Jackie, who was born in December 1941 in Vienna, Austria, but was raised by adoptive parents in England, describes slowly learning about his own past, which his parents had kept from him despite his own faint memories and hints mentioned by relatives. In the memoir, Jackie describes his visit to Theresienstadt, where he was deported as an infant; to Maly Trostinec, where his mother, Elsa Spiegel, was deported and perished; and to Vienna, where he tried to learn more about his mother and her family. He also describes learning more about Bulldogs Bank and Weir Courtney, where he spent several years as a child after being brought from Theresienstadt to England and prior to his adoption.
