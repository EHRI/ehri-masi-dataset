Nazi propaganda poster featuring black and white photographs of happy German children next to text explaining Churchill's devilish plan to enslave German children if the Allies win the war. It describes a plan allegedly broadcast by Reuters news service that children, age 2-6, would be taken from their homes and forced to live abroad for 25 years so that German nationalism would not regenerate and the German race would cease to exist because it would be mixed with other races. The poster was issued on October 7, 1942, for the Parole der Woche (Slogan of the Week) series produced by the Nazi Party in Germany from 1936-1943. It was discontinued in 1943 because of paper shortages caused by the prolonged war.
