United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of one memoir, 25 pages, untitled, by Relli Schmerler Katz, originally of Czechoslovakia. In the memoir, written in 1996, Mrs. Katz describes pre-war Jewish life. Her family was deported in April 1944 to the ghetto in Mátészalka, Hungary, and from there to Auschwitz. She describes the process of arrival in Auschwitz, reuniting with an aunt who had been deported previously, and surviving multiple selections. In August 1944, she and her mother were sent to the Geislingen an der Steige forced labor camp. She describes a number of her specific memories of the camp, including the memory of female prisoners from Bergen-Belsen arriving after a death march. In March 1945, they were sent by passenger train to Dachau, and after about three weeks, placed on a train again. After a number of days, the train was liberated by the United States Army.
