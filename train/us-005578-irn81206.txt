Dr. Hans Stück was a lawyer and notary originally of Wiesbaden, Germany. Though he was a member of the Nazi party, he assisted a number of Jews in the Buchenwald concentration camp. After the war, he was captured and briefly interned in an Allied prisoner of war camp.

Consists of post-war letters by Dr. Hans Stück, testimonies by Allied military personnel and Holocaust survivors about Dr. Stück's pre-war and wartime activities, and photographs of the Stück family. The letters and testimonies describe how Dr. Stück, though nominally a member of the Nazi Party, defended Jews and Jehovah's Witnesses in court, arranged for the removal of Jews from Buchenwald to places which were relatively safer, and facilitated correspondence between concentration camp prisoners and the outside world. The letters and testimonies were written while Stück was interned as a prisoner of war and attempting to secure passage for his family out of the Russian zone to Wiesbaden, where he planned to join them upon his release.
