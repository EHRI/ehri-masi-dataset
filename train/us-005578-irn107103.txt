Charles W. Alexander was born on 2 June 1915 in Paola, Kansas. Prior to World War II, he worked in advertising in Chicago. He was drafted in 1943 and served as the photographer for the commander of the 5th Army. He was discharged in 1945 in order to take a position as a photographer at the Nuremberg trials. He later published two books of photographs of the trials including Justice at Nuremberg, which featured text by Anne Keeshan (1911-1960), whom Charles would later marry.

The collection consists primarily of photographs documenting the Nuremberg trials taken by Charles W. Alexander. The photographs depict the participants in the Nuremberg trials both in the courtroom and behind the scenes, smaller war crimes trials, and scenes of Germany. The collection also includes two books of similar photographs and captions of the personal experiences of Charles and his wife Anne Alexander in Germany in 1945-1946.
