The collection came into existence as a direct result of the investigation by the Czechoslovak authorities of the Jewish ("Zionist") organisations and eventually their prohibition, whereby their archives were confiscated.

The collection was located in the Archives of the Ministry of Interior which was transformed into the Archive of Security Services.

The collection contains documents about activities of Jewish organisations and individuals that were examined by the Czechoslovak security apparatus during the 1950s. It includes materials of Jewish relief organisations, in particular of the American Joint Distribution Committee (JOINT) in Czechoslovakia, documents about Jewish emigration from Czechoslovakia (especially between 1945 and 1950), and of Zionist organisations. It also contains materials about Czechoslovak assistance to Israel in 1948-49, including training and shipments of weaponry.

Among other materials, it also contains a file with selected reports of the war-time Prague Jewish community (425-220-4), information about Czechosloak Jewish organisations in WWII exile in London and materials about persecution of Jews in Ostrava.
