The Hoffman family collection consists of identification documents, correspondence, and photographs related to the Markus Hoffman and Rachela Brande Hoffman, who emigrated from Poland to the Dominican Republic, and their children Leon Hoffman and Berte Hoffman, who were both born in the Dominican Republic. The correspondence, 1939-1941, includes letters from their mothers, Rosa Brande in Czortków, Poland (now Ukraine) and Clara Hoffman in Tłumacz, Poland (now Ukraine), and other extended family members. All family members are presumed to have perished in the Holocaust. Also included are pre-war photographs taken in Poland; medical research papers written and published in Italy by Markus Hoffman, a physician, 1938; Leon and Berte Hoffman’s Dominican Republic passport, 1946; and Leon Hoffman’s naturalization certificate, 1955.
