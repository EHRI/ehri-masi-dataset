Fannie Stern Selig (b. 1892) married Montefiore “Morte” Selig and they had a daughter, Peggy. They lived in Miami, Florida. After World War II, Fannie traveled to Europe and Palestine as a representative of the Jewish Federation in 1947. The mission group traveled from New York to Paris, Prague, Warsaw, Kraków, Geneva, Milan, Rome, and various locations in Palestine. While on the mission trip, Fannie kept a travel log of her daily activity and documented her experiences to various places including children's homes, ORT training programs, Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the Warsaw ghetto. Fannie was very active within the Women's Auxiliary of the Jewish Federation and, at one time, served as President.

The collection consists of a typed copy of a travel log kept by Fannie Stern Selig from 3 November 1947 through 8 December 1947 during her visit to Europe and Palestine as a representative of the Jewish Federation. During her travels she visited DP camps, concentration camps, and children's homes in France, Czech Republic, Poland, Switzerland, Italy, and Palestine. The diary focuses on topics such as her daily experiences, emigration of Jews to Palestine, the care of children, the conditions at abandoned concentration camps, and the challenges Jews faced after the Holocaust. The collection also includes two photographs from Fannie's mission trip.
