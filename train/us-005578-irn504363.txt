Wolf Ajzowicz (1932-1990) wrote the narrative after having read about William Eisen.

Historical fiction narrative describing the experiences of William Eisen (Wolf Ajzowicz) including the public humiliation of Polish Jews by Germans; death of family members; his internment in a ghetto and many concentration camps including Skarżysko-Kamienna, Rakow, the Miechow ghetto, Krakow-Płaszów, and Buchenwald; a death march; his reunion with his sister and a cousin; the displaced persons camps of Judenburg, Austria, and Landsberg am Lech, Germany; and his immigration to the United States. Note: this work of fiction contains some inaccuracies (i.e. gas chambers are said to have been used to kill prisoners in Buchenwald; homosexuals are said to have worn green triangles; soap is said to have been made from the fat of Jews; an evacuation hospital is called a MASH Unit; etc.).
