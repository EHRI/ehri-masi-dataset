"With Only a Toothbrush" is a 12 page manuscript written by Jacky Erwteman in 2004. In the manuscript, Erwteman describes her family background, the family efforts to flee Amsterdam when the Germans invaded and the Dutch Royal Family fled, and their escape by boat to England, where they found employment. Includes information about Erwteman's aunt and uncle, who traveled to the United States and to Curacao, eventually working for the newly established World Bank. After the war, the family discovered that those family members who were unable to escape had been killed in Auschwitz.
