The papers consist of two fliers advertizing a Nazi propaganda board game called, "Juden raus" ("Jews out!"), manufactured by Rudolf Fabricius. "Juden raus" was a sort of amalgam of Monopoly and Halma created by the Nazis as propaganda. The objective was to collect as many Jews as you could and get them off the board. The pieces were little pawns wearing pointed medieval Jewish hats; the players moved them by rolling dice. The child winning was the one whose Jews scurried out, 'off to Palestine!,' through the gates of a walled city.
