Harold Gilman (1917-1999) was born in Denver, CO, and served with the United States Army 11th Armored Division. In May 1945, the division liberated the Mauthausen and Gusen concentration camps in Austria. Gilman used his camera to document the camps.

The Harold Gilman photographs consist of photographs Harold Gilman took at the newly liberated Mauthausen concentration camp and Gusen sub-camp in May 1945. The photographs depict liberated prisoners, former guards, American soldiers, Austrian civilians, and buildings at Gusen and Mauthausen. The photographs show emaciated survivors, corpses, and scenes of summary punishment of former SS guards by their former prisoners and of American soldiers forcing Austrian civilians to dig mass graves for Holocaust victims. Most of the photographs are annotated by Gilman on the verso.
