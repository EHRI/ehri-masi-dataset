His father was captured by Russians and survived working as a cook. His mother survived Bergen Belsen. The Lugosi family eventually immigrated to the U.S. after the 1956 revolution in Hungary.

Collection consists of two photographs, one of Thomas Lugosi with a friend and one of Lugosi with his father.
