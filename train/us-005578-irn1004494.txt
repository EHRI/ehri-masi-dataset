French anti-Bolshevists

Crowd of people outside an anti-Bolshevist rally. Camera pans across a sign that reads "Le peuple Russe contre le Bolchevisme." Dark interiors in a crowded lecture hall. A representative of the Vlasov army (?) speaks (Gelow?). He speaks from a podium in front of a row of uniformed women standing with arms crossed. The crowd applauds enthusiastically. 01:04:19 French volunteers march down the street singing a song. Shots of their suitcases at the train station and the volunteers boarding the train. The sides of the train feature hand-drawn swastikas. One soldier is embraced by an older woman, presumably his mother. The soldiers sing and wave out the window as the train pulls away.
