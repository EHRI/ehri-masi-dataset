Collection consists of six black and white photographs depicting the Rozenblum family (donor's husband's family) from Łódź, Poland. Chaim and Regina Rozenblum, their two daughters, Mania and Rozia and their son Menachem were deported from the Łódź ghetto to Auschwitz-Birkenau in August 1944. Menachem, who was a student in the ghetto high school, was the only survivor of his immediate family. These photographs were returned to Menachem by his uncles in the US after the war.
