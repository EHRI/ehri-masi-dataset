The Muslim Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina was formally established as autonomous religious community in 1909, by the Austria-Hungary's Emperor Franz Joseph I. The organization in Tuzla survived and functioned through period of first Yugoslavian state and was closed down in 1949 by municipal Communist authorities.

During the Second World War (and the rule of the Independent State of Croatia) the Muslim community received numerous requests for conversion to Islamic faith by Jewish families from Tuzla and nearby towns. The documentation includes these requests for approval of conversion, minutes and decisions in this regard. Jewish families applied for conversion in order to avoid persecution, arrest and being sent to concentration camps by Ustasha regime of the Independent State of Croatia.
