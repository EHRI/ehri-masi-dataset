The German decree of 28 October 1940 made it compulsory for all Jews from the age of 15 to register in the Jewish register of the municipality where they officially lived. The names of younger children were added to the forms of the parents (in most cases the copy of the father). Each form has room for the following information : surname, first names, date and place of birth, profession, nationality, religion, date of arrival in Belgium, the country of migration, successive addresses, date and place of registration, and the person’s signature, but also name, date and place of birth and religion of the spouse, the parents, the grandparents and the children. Most of the time not all the information was filled out during the registration process. The Jewish register of Belgium contains ca. 45,000 registration forms from more than 250 municipalities. The registers of Charleroi, Liège (Lüttich/Luik) and Mons (Bergen) are missing.
