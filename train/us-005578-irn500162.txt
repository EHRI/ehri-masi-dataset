Josef and Nesia Zalcman family papers

folder

1

Testimony (photocopied), of Yiddish text, presumably by Josef Zalcman (Joseph Zaltzman), along with photocopies of family photos and post-war DP identification cards for Josef and Nesia Zalcman. Text has partial translation from volunteer, and appears to deal with Zalcman's experiences in a town in Eastern Poland initially occupied by Soviets from 1939-1941, and then by Germans thereafter.
