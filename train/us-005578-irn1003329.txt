Stalingrad (Battle)

Animated map showing Stalingrad and surrounding area. The narrator announces "The Battle for Stalingrad." Stalingrad, which lasted from October 1942 to February 1943, and ended with a German defeat, was the turning point in the war against the USSR. This footage must be from the early days of the battle, when things were going well for the Germans. Two men, with their backs to the camera. One looks through binoculars into the distance. The narrator says that the Germans are firing on an ordnance factory. Shots of cannons firing alternate with shots of the city being shelled. Stukas flying over the city. Germans loading and firing howitzers. German infantry cautiously approaching the destroyed ordnance factory; a German tank rolls over the rubble. More shots of German soldiers shooting, covering behind hills of rubble and partially destroyed buildings. Good semi-close shots of soldiers, with the narration, "These are the fighters for Stalingrad." The narrator tells of the dangers lurking as the soldiers advance, meter by meter, into the city. Lots of good shots of destroyed city, Germans advancing. Interior of destroyed buildings. Columns of Soviet POWS march down streets and along a road.
