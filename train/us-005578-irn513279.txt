Risa Silbert (born Risa Kagan) was born in Memel (now Klaipeda), Lithuania on September 7, 1929 to Tevye and Irla Kagan. Risa's father and brother, Hessel, were killed in a massacre at the Seventh Fort in Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1941, and Risa, her mother, and her sister, Henny, moved into the ghetto in the Slobodka suburb of Kaunas. Risa was caught in a round-up in the ghetto in 1943 and deported first to a labor camp in Estonia and then to Stutthof concentration camp.

The 13-page manuscript was written by Risa Silbert (née Kagan), originally of Klaipėda, Lithuania, immediately after her liberation from Stutthof concentration camp and describes her family and their experiences during the Holocaust.
