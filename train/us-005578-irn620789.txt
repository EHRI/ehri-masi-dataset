I'm An American -- Konrad Bercovici

On November 24, 1940 Konrad Bercovici spoke with Bern Berard, Executive Assistant of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, about the necessity of Americanization for all Americans. Ms. Berard suggests all native Americans should take the naturalization test. Bercovici agrees. He recalls a time during WWI where Americanization was taught in Romania. He speculates if it had continued there may not be as many troubles plaguing Europe today. The author claims immigrants resist the melting pot because they cling to their backgrounds, until they find a place in America like their native lands. Bercovici encourages Americans to help new citizens find opportunities for work. He believes machines are helping to free humanity. The episode closes with Bercovici telling the story of his conversation with a Romanian immigrant living in America. Konrad Bercovici was born in Romania in 1882 to a Jewish family. His family lived in Galaţi among Greeks, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Jews, and Roma. According to his autobiography, Bercovici developed a deep connection with the Roma culture because of his nursemaid and his father’s business dealings. The family emigrated to Paris after the patriarch died from injuries sustained during antisemitic riots in 1893. Influenced by the 1900 World’s Fair, Bercovici attended the Université Populaire to become an organist. He met his wife, sculptor Naomi Librescu, while living in Paris. The couple emigrated to Montreal and later settled in Manhattan. Bercovici worked in sweatshops, gave piano lessons and began writing. He went on to write for Harper’s Bazaar and literary fiction that explored Roma themes.
