The documents have been in the possession of the Jewish community since the war.

The series contains the documents of the Jewish Council that had been in the possession of the Jewish community since 1944-1945. The records include financial and administrative papers, internal exchange, notes and reports of various organizations and departments of the Council regarding its daily operation and the implementation of the Hungarian and German authorities’ orders as well as correspondence of the Council and these authorities. Relatively rich are the materials of the Social Department and the Housing Office. Though the Council’s scope of authority was restricted almost exclusively to Budapest, the body of documents holds a large amount of information regarding the plunder, ghettoization and deportation of the countryside communities through the surviving registry sheets created by the Council to systemize the information it gathered from various sources pertaining to the events outside the capital. The series also contains the results of the nationwide survey of Jewish communities implemented by the Council upon the order of the German authorities, accumulating organizational and financial information on over 700 communities.
