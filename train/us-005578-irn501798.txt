Contains David Elentukh's handwritten memoir, in Russian. In the memoir, Mr. Elentukh describes his pre-war life in Minsk, being drafted into the military in 1941, and escaping to return to his family and move with them into the Minsk ghetto. Elentukh was transferred from the ghetto for forced labor in Minsk, escaped to return to the ghetto, and went into hiding in a cellar. After emerging from hiding, Elentukh and his family were rounded up and marched outside of Minsk to be shot. He managed to run from the column and escape, joining the partisans with his brother-in-law. In 1944, Elentukh joined the Red Army. At the end of the memoir, Mr. Elentukh appended copies of wartime documentation.
