Manfred Wildmann (1930- ) was born in Karlsruhe to Heinrich (1888-1943) and Rebecca Wildmann (1895-1942). His siblings were Margot (1922- ), Hugo (1924-1944), and Hannelore (1925- ), and the family lived in Philippsburg. They were deported to Vichy France in 1940 and imprisoned in Gurs and Rivesaltes. Hannelore was released in 1941 to work in a children’s home in Pringy, Manfred was released in 1942 to a children’s home in Grammont (Haute-Saône) and later joined Hannelore, and Margot was released in 1942 to a children’s home and then worked for a family as a maid. Hugo was detailed to the work camp at Le Barcarès, and he and Rebecca were transferred to Drancy in August 1942. Both were then sent to Auschwitz and perished. Heinrich, who had been transferred to a hospital in Perpignan, was transferred to Drancy in November 1943 and the following month to Auschwitz where he perished. Manfred and Hannelore immigrated to the United States in 1947. (See also the family’s website at http://wildmannbirnbaum.com.)

The Wildmann family letters consist of correspondence among Heinrich, Rebecca, Manfred, Hannelore, Margot, and Hugo Wildmann. The letters describe camp conditions, health and sanitary concerns, and food availability at the concentration camps at Rivesaltes and Le Barcarès, Heinrich’s situation at a hospital in Perpignan, Manfred’s situation at the children’s home in Grammont, and the family’s efforts to find better arrangements for each of them. The collection is accompanied by transcriptions and annotated translations created by Manfred and Sylvia Wildmann.
