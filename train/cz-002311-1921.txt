The documents were stored in the registries of individual company departments. In the post-war years, other important documents kept from raids in the country were gradually stored in the newly established offices of the Svit company. The Svit Company Archives was established in 1960. In September 2012, the fonds of Baťa, a. s., Zlín was handed over to the Zlín State District Archives.

In 1908, Tomáš Baťa became the sole owner of a footwear company. The First World War marked a transition from a local small-scale production to the future worldwide company. A foreign network of company stores began to develop in the early 1920s. The World War II provided an economic potential. New markets opened for the company due to its connection with the Third Reich and the older markets were then filled with new programs. At the same time, the connection of the company to the Nazi Germany remained sufficiently flexible, so that at the time of the Germany defeat, the company easily broke away from its economic and social structures. After the end of the war, a temporary administration was appointed to head the company, and on October 27, 1945, the company was nationalized.

The fonds contains documents on the operation of the company and its activities in 1894-1948.
