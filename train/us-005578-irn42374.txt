Contains administrative and personal files created by the Central Information Bureau for Jewish War Sufferers in the Far East, and the Hilfsverein der Juden in Deutschland (Aid Society of the Jews in Germany). The administrative files include correspondence from the Central Information Bureau for Jewish War Sufferers in the Far East with Jewish communities and international Jewish and non-Jewish aid and migration organizations in various parts of the world, including New Zealand, Italy, China, Switzerland, Germany and Nazi-annexed Austria, Australia, Great Britain, Yugoslavia, Poland, several countries in Latin America, and the United States, among others. Cables and correspondence, mostly in Yiddish and Russian, were sent during the interwar period starting in 1918 by the Central Information Bureau for Jewish War Sufferers in the Far East to facilitate the emigration of Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe.The personal files include approximately 3,000 emigration applications received in the years between 1938-1940 by the Hilfsverein der Juden in Deutschland (Aid Society of the Jews in Germany) from Jews living in Austria, Germany, Italy, and Poland, asking for assistance with emigration to Harbin and Shanghai. These applications were forwarded to the Far Eastern Jewish Central Information Bureau (DALJEWCIB), often in response to job announcements posted abroad in Harbin or Shanghai. The personal files consist of a wide variety of personal documents, such as emigration applications, correspondence, photographs, curricula vitae, reference letters, name lists, search requests, and other documents.
