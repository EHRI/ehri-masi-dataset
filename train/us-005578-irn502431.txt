Schmuel Rakowski, now Samuel Ron, the son of Joseph and Sophie Banach Rakowski, was born on July 28, 1924 in Kazimierza Wielka. Schmuel worked in the town's sugar processing plant and eventually smuggled himself along with his parents, Joseph and Sophie Banch Rakowski into the Krakow ghetto. When Krakow residents were moved to camp Płaszów, Schmuel was transferred to another camp, Pionki, an ammunitions plant. Schmuel's mother and aunt went to Skarzysko while Schmuel's father, brother, and cousin were transferred to Mauthausen in 1944. Schmuel was on a death march in April 1945 before being liberated by American troops on May 2, 1945. His mother and aunt survived Gross-Rosen and his father survived Mauthausen. Schmuel joined his father in Austria in the Bindermichl Displaced persons camp, but spent most of his time working as a guide for Bricha. Between August 1945 and March 1946 Schmuel brought people from Eastern Europe to Italy and France helping them to escape to Palestine. In March 1946, he helped escort 1100 children to Palestine on board the illegal ship, the Champollion. Schmuel arrived in Palestine on April 28, 1946.
