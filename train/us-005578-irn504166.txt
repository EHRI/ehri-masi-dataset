James A. Livesay was a veteran of the 104th U.S. Infantry Division during World War II, and was at Nordhausen's liberation.

The records relate to James Livesay's experiences at the liberation of Nordhausen (a.k.a. Dora, Dora-Mittelbau): an original photograph that Livesay took during the burial of the camp's inmates accompanied by a brief testimony of Livesay's; two 1945 newspaper clippings from a West Virginia newspaper, "The Register," describing the activities of Livesay and the 104th U.S. Infantry Division; a copy of a "Witness to the Holocaust" questionnaire distributed by Emory University's Center for Research in Social Change that Livesay filled out to describe his war-time experiences, including those which led to his subsequent psychological problems; and photocopies of photographs of dead Nordhausen prisoners.
