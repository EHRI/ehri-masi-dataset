12 pages

Achille Finzi was a lawyer; born in Mantua in 1853, he died in 1916. He was under surveillance because he was a republican: none of the documents related to him ever contains the world “Jew”. Only when his death certificate was asked by “Ministero dell’Interno” (Ministry of the Interior) in 1942 in order to cancel his name from the Central Political Records-Office in Rome, then the word “Ebreo” (Jewish) was added on his death certificate using a stamp.
