Julius Butzke was born on April 14, 1899 in Vienna, Austria. He trained as an accountant. On June 15, 1923, he married Netty Freiberger, who had been born on November 14, 1899, and had worked as a nurse during World War I. On March 28, 1929, she gave birth to the couple's only child, a son named Hans. In the 1930s, Julius collected family birth certificates, baptismal records, and other identity papers to support his family's attempts to emigrate. Netty worked for the Jewish Community of Vienna's hospital until 1939. In 1940, the family was able to emigrate, first to Panama and then to the United States. Hans changed his name to John and attended the City University of New York and later served in the United States Marine Corps, fighting in Korea. Julius Butzke passed away in 1942, and Netty in 1985. John Butzke passed away in 2010.

Consists of papers and photographs related to family of Julius, Netty, and John (Hans) Butzke, originally of Vienna, Austria. Includes papers from Julius's pre-war work as an accountant, Netty's pre-war work as a nurse (including service during World War I) and the official papers they collected to support their attempts to immigrate. Includes passports and other travel documents, and documents establishing their lives in the United States. This collection is an excellent example of a small family collection related to immigration from Vienna to the United States. Pre-war documents establish the family’s life in Vienna, while also demonstrating Julius Butzke’s detailed attempts to collect genealogical records to assist with their eventual emigration from Vienna. The collection also details the family’s life in the United States. A large collection of family photographs inserted into a photograph album shows pre-war life in Vienna.
