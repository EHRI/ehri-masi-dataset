Indyk family letters

box

1

Contains letters and photographs regarding the Holocaust experiences and post-war life of Eva Indyk, originally of Poland. Eva's older sister, Telma (Tillie), had immigrated to the United States as a teenager, and tried to convince her parents to allow her siblings to join her in America before the war. After the war, Tillie found out that only Eva had survived and had been in Auschwitz. The collection contains letters from Eva to Tillie, in which she dreamed of reuniting with her sister in the United States. Eva was unable to obtain the proper visas and eventually immigrated to Israel, where she passed away in 1954. The focus of the collection is on Eva's post-war life as a survivor in Europe, her recovery from illnesses caused by her camp experiences, and her difficulty obtaining visas to join her sister in the United States.
