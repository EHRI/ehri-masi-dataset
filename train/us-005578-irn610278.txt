Czesław (later Chester) Mondschein was born on November 29, 1921 in Krakow, Poland, and was the only child of Jacob and Esther Mondschein. Anna Leniower Mondschein was born on January 31, 1923 in Krakow to Abraham (b. 1890) and Franceska (b. 1893) Leniower. She had a twin sister, Frieda, and a younger sister Ella (b. 1925). Abraham managed farms and estates before the war. After the start of World War II, both the Mondschein and Leniower families fled to the Soviet Union. Czesław and Anna met on the train, and they ended up working in labor camps in Siberia. Both families then went to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Czesław’s mother, Esther, died while they were living there. After the war both families returned to Poland, and in September 1946 went to the displaced persons camp near Steyr, Austria. Czesław and Anna married and had their son Jakob (b. 1949) while in the camp. They immigrated to the United States in 1949.

The Mondschein family photograph collection contains five photograph albums relating to the Mondschein and Leniower families in Poland prior to the World War II, and their post-war time in the displaced persons camp near Steyr, Austria, 1946-1949.
