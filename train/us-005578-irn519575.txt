Laura Sacerdote Perrini (1909-2007) was born Laura Sacerdote on 23 July 1909 in Asti, Italy to Edoardo Sacerdote (1883-1971) and Palmira Segre (1883-1951). She grew up in a Jewish family with two siblings: Giacomo Sacerdote (1911-1960) and Lidia Sacerdote (later Lidia Lattes, 1908-1999). Her father was in the Royal Italian Army, and a veteran of World War I. Laura studied at the University of Milan and began teaching in a high school in Saluzzo, Italy in 1931. She married a Catholic man, Paolo Perrini, and they had 5 children: Franca Perrini (b. 1934), Paola Perrini (b. 1936), Carla Perrini (later Carla Potter, b. 1938), Mario Perrini (b. 1941), and Anna Perrini (b. 1945). Paolo was a high school philosophy teacher. In 1938 antisemetic legislation was passed in Italy and Laura was fired from her job in Saluzzo. She baptized her children in an effort to keep them safe, and hid with them in several locations in the Varaita Valley from 1943-1945. After the war she returned to teaching, and the family later moved to Turin.

Abramo Segre (nicknamed Mino, 1920-1945?) was born on 9 July 1920 in the Chivasso commune of Turin, Italy to Ernesta Serena Sacerdote (1884-1943) and Adolfo Segre. He had one sister Rosa Segre (1922-1943). Abramo graduated high school in 1938, and worked as an accountant. He was engaged to Lucia Bracco. On 25 October 1943 Abramo, along with his mother and sister, was arrested in Chivasso and imprisoned in Turin. They were transferred to a prison in Milan on 1 December 1943. On 6 December 1943 Abramo and his family were deported to Auschwitz. His mother and sister were killed shortly after arrival, but Abramo was selected for forced-labor. He likely perished on a death march in February 1945. While on the train to Auschwitz, Abramo wrote a last letter to Lucia on 7 December 1943 which was eventually delivered to her.

The collection documents the Holocast-era experiences of Laura Sacerdote Perrini of Saluzzo, Italy and her relative Abramo Segre of Chivasso, Italy. Included are a handwritten personal narrative in Italian authored by Laura regarding her Holocaust experiences in Italy; two letters authored by Abramo to his fiancee Lucia Bracco, along with a will, dated 7 December 1943; and a genealogical chart of Sacerdote Perrini and Segre families. The letters are dated 30 November and 7 December 1943, and include transcriptions and English translations. The 7 December 1943 letter and will were written by Abramo on a train to Auschwitz, and were the last letter received by Lucia from him.
