The Israelitische Allianz was created as a branch of the Paris-based Alliance Israelite Universelle. The Allianz aided Jews who were being oppressed by the authorities in the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires, and Jews in the Balkan countries, organized Jewish schools, provided assistance to victims of pogroms in Russia, and to emigrants form Easter Europe countries, and cooperated with other Jewish charitable organizations. The organization was liquidated after Austrian Anschluss in 1938.

The collection contains letters and correspondence with other Jewish organizations; minutes of the Council of the Alliance in Vienna and the Joint Foreign Committee of the Israelite Alliance in London; reports from neighboring countries including those of the Portuguese Marranos Committee, French organizations, the Netherlands, and Belgium; correspondence from 1935 to 1936 about the release of a film entitled "Process of Millennium" about the persecution of Jews; correspondence about arranging public canteens from 1936 to 1938; financial statements and minutes of the organization’s board; lists of members and persons receiving grants as well as files of donations to the organization and purchase of land; memoranda by Jewish communities to the League of Nations, appeals requesting aid for Jewish refugees; clippings from newspapers and journals, the copies of issues of various Jewish journals, newspaper, bulletins, books and pamphlets. There are also manuscripts of works on historical, philosophical, and theosophical subjects originating from materials of other institutions. Note: USHMM Archives holds only selected records.
