Consists of one bound memoir entitled "LOL* After 67 Years" written in 2012 by Peter R. Span, who was born in 1938 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, In the memoir, he describes the bombing of Belgrade which ended the attempts of his parents, Ignac Rosenfeld and Elisabeth Span, to emigrate with their sons to Mexico. After the bombing, the family moved to Subotica and in 1942 and again in 1944, Ignac was sent to a forced labor battalion. In the summer of 1944, Elisabeth and her sons (including Peter) were deported to the Ulrichskirchen labor camp in Austria, where they remained until liberation in April 1945, after which they returned to Subotica. There, they reunited with Ignac, who died of disease in December 1945. Elisabeth emigrated with her sons to Mexico in 1947. The memoir includes many photographs, and Span roots his family's story in the context of world events.
