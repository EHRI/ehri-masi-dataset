Gömbös Gyula miniszterelnöki iratai

1 fasc., 0,16 linear metres

The collection was acquired by the Hungarian National Archive in 1948.

Gyula Gömbös (1886-1936) was a politician and soldier, member of the Hungarian Parliament, Minister of Defense (1929-1932) and eventually Prime Minister of Hungary (1932-1936). During the 1920s, Gömbös oscillated between the governing party led by Prime Minister István Bethlen and a more radical race protectionist platform. Upon becoming Prime Minister, Gömbös announced a wideranging plan of reorganization with the aim of establishing a more modern and rightist authoritarian state, opposing the more liberally oriented conservative elite in particular. He reformed the army by giving posts to his own supporters. His foreign policy was based on alliances with Italy and Austria but also on close ties to the new Central European power that was Nazi Germany. The centerpiece of this archival collection is the correspondence of Gyula Gömbös. Dossier A contains the secret correspondence between Gömbös and Benito Mussolini in the years 1933 to 1935. There is a dossier of reports on the activities of his governments for the years 1932 to 1935. Last but not least, there is a dossier containing the letters and telegraphs of condolence that were received upon the death of Gömbös in 1936.
