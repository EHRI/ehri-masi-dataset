Lachman, Norbert

Documents relate to the tenuous situation for Norbert Lachman and his family as Jews in Danzig the late 1930s; his subsequent experiences as a student at an ORT school in Berlin; his return to Danzig in 1939 and his memories of the situation for Jews at that time; and immigration with his family to New York by way of Berlin, Ostend, and London.
