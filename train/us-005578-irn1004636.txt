German supplies and relief work during and after the campaign in France

Line of German tanks on country road. Animated map traces German advance from Sedan to Abb√©ville in France, which was rapid despite what French newspapers predicted would be halted by fuel shortage. Fuel drums are loaded onto trucks in long line, unloaded from Junker planes and transported by Deutsche Reichsbahn trucks with trailers over bridge, past Wehrmacht signposts to Kraut, Mecheln, Krankensammelstelle [casualty center] and Brussels. Convoy passes Belgian traffic policeman in town and continues along country road. Lack of fuel foiled the attempted flight by "Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats, with cases full of gold ingots and jewels", whose cars, some camouflaged against aerial attack, line the roadside; "this is how these deserters and friends of England, traitors to their people, sought to escape on foot from their responsibility". The evacuated French return: peasants sit on carts with their possessions, including one family towing a car. Germans "can thank Hitler" for being spared from refugee status. Scenes of refugees with prams, bicycles, and farm vehicles, passing through town, sitting dishevelled beneath trees, mother nursing baby, children smiling in cart and hens in boxes. NSV (Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt with French translation) food stall near port, staffed by German women who have reportedly rapidly won respect and trust in the enemy land. Distributing food to women and child refugees ("these betrayed people"). NSV woman comfortingly holds poor child. Very brief view of German prisoners of war in French custody.
