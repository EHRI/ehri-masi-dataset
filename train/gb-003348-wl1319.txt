1 folder

Alwin Goldschmied, was arrested in April 1938 by the Gestapo and eventually perished in Auschwitz having reached there via Drancy. The daughter, the depositor, Ellinor, came to England in 1939 with the assistance of the Quakers. Maria Goldschmied seems to have spent the majority of the war in a small town called Stiefern with relatives some 90 km from Vienna. In August 1946 she came to England.

This collection of family documents describes the plight of a Viennese family: an aryan woman, her Jewish husband and their daughter. In addition to some original documentation, there are 2 personal accounts by the mother, Maria Goldschmied, which cover the period from the arrival of the Nazis to the 1970s when she used to still visit her native Austria. Of particular interest are the memoirs at 1319/11-12 and material relating to Alwin Goldschmied's arrest, including a visitor's pass allowing his wife to visit him in prison which was retained and used to rebut official denials that he was arrested in the first place (1319/2).<br><div>Note copies retained.
