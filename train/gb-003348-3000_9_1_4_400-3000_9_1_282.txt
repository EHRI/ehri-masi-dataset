It centres on the exchange of information material, work and restitution related enquiries on events or individuals related to the Nazi era, the discussion of current affairs, especially on politics and antisemitism in West Germany, and the publication of several articles by E. J. Cohn in the Library’s Bulletin.

Beside letters, the correspondence contains the transcript of a newspaper article as well the transcript of a speech given by German politician Franz Böhm on a radio show. Both concern the controversial dismissal of German restitution lawyer Otto Küster in 1954. Moreover, the correspondence includes copies of two export reports on an antisemitic book German Jurist Reinhart Maurach had published in 1939.
