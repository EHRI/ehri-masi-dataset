1 electronic ressource (2 pages)

This file contains a letter from 1937, written by Loosli to Saly Mayer. Loosli corresponds with Mayer about his publishing work and how it is influenced by the Bern trials. The trials do not only prevent him from working on anything not related to the trial, but also make it essential to remain silent in the media in matters not connected to the trial.
