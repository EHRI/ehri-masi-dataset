Bloeme Emden (later Evers-Emden) was born on July 26, 1926 to Emanuel Emden and Rosa in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Her father, a socialist, worked as a diamond cutter. For the first years of World War II, the Emden family was able to remain together in Amsterdam because Emanuel's skills were in high demand, but in July 1942, Bloeme received a letter ordering her deportation. Emanuel went to the Zentralstelle Für Jüdische Auswanderung where he met with a sympathetic German who crossed out the order and stamped "gesperrt" releasing Bloeme from deportation.

The photograph depicts a 15 to 16-year-old Bloeme Evers-Emden with her hair pinned back and wearing glasses; on her chest is pinned a yellow star.
