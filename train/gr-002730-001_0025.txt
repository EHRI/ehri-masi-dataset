The largest prewar Greek Jewish comm
unity was in Salonika, located in
northern Greece and later in the German occ
upied zone. At the time of the German
occupation, Salonika had a Jewish popul
ation of about 50,000. In July 1942, 2,000
Jewish males in Salonika were assigned to
forced-labor projects for the German army.
Another 7,000 were ransomed from the Nazis
with funds raised in desperation by the
Jewish community. In February
1943, the Germans concentrated the Jews of
Salonika in two ghetto areas of the city. Be
tween March and August of that year, German
officials deported over 40,000 Jews from
Salonika to the Auschwitz-Birkenau
extermination camp. SS members stationed at
Birkenau murdered virtually all of the
Salonikan Jews upon arrival.

The archive contains 4.200 declarations of mobile/immobile property corresponding to 13.400 Jews and they are all dated on the 1st of March 1943.The cards contain
personal information as well as itemized lists
of real and material property subsequently
aryanized by occupying forces
and Greek collaborators.
