The reports are published by the Information Service of The International Bureau for the Right of Asylum and Aid to Political Refugees. This organisation was created by the Conférence Internationale pour le Droit d'Asile, held in Paris on June 20-21, 1936. It served as an umbrella organization for all German émigré associations. A major aim of the organization was to lobby the League of Nations for a more secure refugee status. The organisation's secretary general was Paul Perrin, a left wing deputy, who was also president of the Centre de Liaison des Comités pour le Statut des Immigrés, and one of eight members of a consultative commission, nominated by the French minister of the interior, with the object of screening applicants for refugee status.

The reports and other papers in this collection concern a proposed international convention on the problem of refugees from Nazi Germany, in France.
