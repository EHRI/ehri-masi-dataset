Hindenburg speaks at rally

Goebbels in profile in trenchcoat. At Lustgarten, Berlin. In BG soldier and journalist in bowtie and hat. Big camera visible too. Great MLS of camera on tripod. Pan out across swarming crowd. Hindenburg walking through crowd, up to podium. Looks very professorial. "Heils"; holding top hat. Hindenburg speaks, greets crowd. Reads from paper with big print in gloved hand (age). Then, hurrahs, big cheers with raised fist, National Anthem. Remainder of reel contains: Hysterical crowds at another event. Nazi banners. Fireworks. Spotlights. Train station?
