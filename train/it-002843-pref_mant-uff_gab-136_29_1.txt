Bianca Massarani was a Jewish woman born in Mantua on December 12th, 1891. Her father was Emanuele and her mother Delfina Gugenheim. In 1945 two properties owned by her were confiscated by Ente Gestione e liquidazione immobiliare beni ebraici (Management and Liquidation Office of Jewish Real Estate Properties or “Egeli”; see this fonds in this portal, child items n° 1 and n° 2 - busta n° 1, n° 63; busta n° 5, n° 567). She had lost Italian citizenship and in 1954 she unsuccessfully tried to recover it, sponsored by two priests (don Giovanni Guernelli and monsignor Giulio Ghidoni).
