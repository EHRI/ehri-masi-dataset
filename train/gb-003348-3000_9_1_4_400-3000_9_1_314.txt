Correspondence with Demuth, Fritz

65 items

Dr. Fritz Demuth (1876-1965) was a German economist and liberal politician. He emigrated to Switzerland in 1933, and later to England where he became a highly regarded figure among Germans in Exile. See Röder, W. and H. Strauss (ed.), , Munich, Saur, 1980, pp. 124-25.

The correspondence throws light on the network of Demuth’s friends and acquaintances in Great Britain, and his high reputation. Only its minor part is with Demuth himself concerning his contribution to the Library’s eyewitness testimony project as well as arrangements of events and potential participants. Instigated by Alfred Wiener the correspondence’s main part, however, involves numerous other correspondents, and centres on arrangements for Demuth’s 80th Birthday in January 1956.

Beside handwritten and typewritten letters the bundle of papers includes lists of contributors to a present for Demuth’s birthday, two postcards, and a memo of a conversation about financial support for The Wiener Library by West German authorities (1957).
