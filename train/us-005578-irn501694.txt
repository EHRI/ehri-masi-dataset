The Margalit Bar-On collection consists of copies of typed and handwritten poems, some with modern photographs included, and photocopies of photographs of the Mydlarz family, originally of Łódź, Poland. The poems were written by Margalit Mydlarz Bar-On between 1973-1989. The poems describe her experiences in the Łódź ghetto, Auschwitz, Harburg, her liberation from Bergen-Belsen, and time in Sweden for recovery. She also describes her illegal immigration to Palestine, capture, and internment in Cyprus.
