Part II is a description of her family's experiences during the Soviet occupation of the town in 1939; the flight to Lvov, Poland (Lviv, Ukraine) of her parents, brother and sister while she remained in Ostrog with her married sister and her family so she could continue her schooling; her joining her family in Lvov in 1941; the pogroms against Lvov Jews which followed the Nazi capture of the city in 1941, during the course of which her father and brother, Grisha, were shot and killed; her mother's temporary success at obtaining working papers for herself, Janet, and Janet's sister, Anya, thus avoiding deportation or resettlement in the ghetto; her mother's arrest by the Gestapo and transport to Treblinka early in 1942; her and Anya's decision to go to Germany where each went her own way, posing as Christians and working as domestic help on various farms and estates; her return to Lvov after liberation where she attended school under her assumed Christian name; and her move to Warsaw (Poland) where she worked with war orphans and met her future husband, Feliks Puterman, a Polish painter and fellow survivor. Part III concerns her post-war experiences in Warsaw where she contacted the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee which put her in touch with relatives in New York City; her reunion with her sister, Anya, in an unnamed Polish displaced persons camps near Frankfurt (Germany); her move, with Feliks, to Paris (France) where Feliks painted and exhibited; her trip to New York City in 1947 to visit her relatives; Feliks's move to New York; their marriage and move to Montreal (Canada) shortly thereafter; and their return to the United States a few years later.
