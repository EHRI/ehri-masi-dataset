Martha Holzmann and her twin sister Erna Holzmann (later Steckerl) were born in Vienna on April 27, 1907. They had one older sister, Irma Holzmann (later Farkas), born approximately 1904. The three sisters were the daughters of Sigmund and Mathilda (Engel) Holzmann. Sigmund was a highly decorated WWI veteran, who was awarded the Austrian Cross of Valor, and was permanently disabled as a result of his service. It was Mathilde’s second marriage; she was a widow with one son, Otto Engel. Shortly after the Anschluss, Martha married Wilhelm Braun and immigrated to the United States. Not long after her arrival, she divorced Mr. Braun and later married Frank Deutscher. Both of Martha’s sisters also immigrated to the United States, her sister Erna arriving in 1940. Their parents perished in Auschwitz. Erna married Alex Steckerl, a Holocaust survivor who died of cancer a few years after his arrival to the United States.
