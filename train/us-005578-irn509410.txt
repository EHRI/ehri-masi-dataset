Ivory cuff bracelet presented to an SS member, engraved with swastikas and Munich, Germany, 1933. The SS (Schutzstaffel; Protection Squadrons), commanded by Heinrich Himmler from 1929, considered itself an elite corps of the Nazi Party based on race-nationalist visions of racial purity. In 1936, the SS established the Lebensborn (Fount of Life) program that decreed that every SS man should father four children, in or out of wedlock. Lebensborn homes were created to house and care for the illegimate children and their mothers.
