Gerstenmaier was born in Kirchenheim near Stuttgart, on August 25 1906. He left school at 14 and worked for 8 years as a clerk before embarking on studies in philosophy and theology at TÃ¼bingen University. His first clash with Nazism came in 1934 when he was arrested while still a student. His continued opposition to the regime cost him a teaching post at Berlin University two years later, and he turned to work in the Evangelical Church.

This microfilm collection of papers of the Nazi authorities in Yugoslavia comprises letters, proclamations and reports of German police units. It is significant because it includes an order which explicitly mentions their intent to systematically murder the adult male population of Hrastnigg, Kanker and Zavoden, in former Yugoslavia, and to 're-settle' the remaining population. The units involved were reserve Police Batallion 93; Police Batallion 322; Reserve Police Batallion109.
