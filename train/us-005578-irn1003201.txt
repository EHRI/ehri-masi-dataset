Von Papen speaks

Title: "Reich Chancellor talks to you - Count von Papen declares through Movietone that all Germany asks is justice from the other nations." A format very similar to story 3729, in which Bruening speaks. Franz von Papen is shown seated at a desk and reads in English from a speech that he holds in his hands. He first dons and then removes his glasses toward the end of the speech. The camera moves closer after the first couple of sentences. He says he is glad to have the opportunity of "addressing a few words to the American public" and speaks of the "discriminating provisions of the Treaty of Versailles." He concludes by saying that we should learn from the past to build a better future.
