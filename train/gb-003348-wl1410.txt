The provenance of the collection is unknown.

Julius Jung was an active member of a number of committees and organisations which catered to the needs of the Jewish community. In particular, he was Honorary Secretary of the B'nai B'rith Care Committee for Refugee Children (see 1410/3410, 3509, 3423 for minutes of the hostel committee meetings). Much of the correspondence deals with this activity. As a member of the University of London Jewish Students' Union, he was also involved in assisting German Jewish academics and students who had been excluded from universities on racial grounds in 1931-2. In addition he was secretary of the Jewish Friends Food Fund.
