It was established on December 17, 1939 in the territory of the General Government under the regulation of the Governor-General Hans Frank. Under the threat of the death penalty, it was called to serve the pre-war policemen. The source of the first replenishment was the policemen displaced from the territories incorporated into the Third Reich. Throughout the German occupation, most of the navy blue policemen were recruited from pre-war Polish policemen. The Germans imposed on the existing State Police apparatus the obligation of full, ongoing protection of public safety and order. According to the order of Heinrich Himmler on May 5, 1940, "providing the general police service in the GG is the task of the Polish police. The German police only enter if German interest so requires and supervises the Polish police." The blue police were completely subordinate to the local German police, there was no central command, the Polish command did not go beyond the poviat level. [Source: Wikipedia]

Administrative and personal files, reports about fire and assaults, summons, leading people avoiding the so-called Construction Service (Baudienst) and farmers, people wanted by the Employment Office (Arbeitsamt), operations ordered by German Police and reports about various incidents on the area of the Radom county. The materials constitute remnants of files of the Polish Police (the so-called “blue police”) county command in Radom (within the occupier’s boundaries, i.e. along with a territory of the entire pre-war Kozienice County). The files were excluded from the County Starosty (Kreishauptman) Radom collection.
