Consists of correspondence sent to the family of Ludwig (later Louis), Theresa, and Jo Ann (Hansi) Lustig, who left Germany in August 1939 and emigrated to the United States. The handwritten correspondence, dated between 1939-1943, was mainly sent by Theresa's father, Albert Kahn, who remained in Munich, Germany. The correspondence relates to family and emigration issues as well as the deteriorating situation for Jews in Germany. Albert Kahn was deported to Theresienstadt, where he died in September 1943; many other family members referenced in the correspondence also perished in the Holocaust.
