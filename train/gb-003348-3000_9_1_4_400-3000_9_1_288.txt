Correspondence with Comité International d’Auschwitz (CIA)

77 items

The (CIA) was founded by survivors of the concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz in 1952. Its main mission is to represent the interests of the camp’s survivors and their relatives. The CIA is further committed to secure the role of Auschwitz in moral and political debates, and in the education of younger generations.

﻿The correspondence - with CIA general secretary Hermann Langbein almost exclusively - covers various issues. This includes a CIA conference at the Auschwitz memorial site (1957); information and material requests on numerous perpetrators (among others C. Clauberg, A. Beckerle, A. Boger, A. Eichmann, E. Veesenmeyer, F. Rademacher, F. Benzler, A. Brunner and J. Mengele); postwar trials of perpetrators and Auschwitz related eyewitness accounts; mutual assistance on practical issues, for instance access to Library’s press surveys, finding an English translator for the memoirs of Rudolf Höss (1958) or coordinated actions to support the extradition of a former Auschwitz camp physician Horst Schumann from Ghana (1962). The correspondence further sheds lights on the work of Emmi Moravitz who compiled survivor testimonies for The Wiener Library’s eyewitness testimonies project.
