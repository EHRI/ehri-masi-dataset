The correspondence was acquired by the Hungarian National Archives in 1948.

Kálmán Darányi (1886-1939) was a politician who served as Minister of Agriculture and later as Prime Minister of Hungary (1936-1938), replacing the deceased Gyula Gömbös. In March 1938, the program of Győr, a massive program of military and infrastructural development, was initiated under his premiership. The program was conceived by Béla Imrédy, Minister of Economic Coordination who was to become his immediate successor. At first pursuing balancing acts, Darányi clearly shifted to the right in the latter parts of his premiership. He was to initiate the First Anti-Jewish Law that was eventually introduced in May 1938 and extended anti-Jewish legal discrimination from the realm of higher education (the numerus clausus law of 1920) to the whole society and aimed to reduce Jewish socioeconomic participation in a host of areas to below 20%. The collection contains the correspondence of Kálmán Darányi from the years 1930 to 1936. The correspondence concerns various issues such as elections, parliamentary life, associations, the press, the program of Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös (1932-36), governmental reports and press items. A significant part is more of a personal nature.
