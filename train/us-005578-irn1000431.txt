Lvov/Lemberg massacre; Jews arrested

Townspeople watch, shocked and tearful, as dead bodies from Lemberg (Lvov) massacre are carried from the prison in which they were killed and laid aside in lines for identification. The retreating Soviets had massacred the mostly Ukrainian nationalist prisoners. The Germans blamed the massacre on the Jews -- "Innocent victims of Bolsheviks," says narrator. Bullet-pocked, smoking buildings, grisly pans of bloody, mangled corpses. Wailing woman, stunned onlookers. Poor quality HA views of man being arrested, trying to kick himself free. CU propagandistic shots of Jewish men who "helped" (narrator) being rounded up, arrested.
