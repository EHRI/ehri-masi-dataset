The work entitled, "The beginning of the end," contains three memoirs written by Lilly Gassner and Chaviva Guttmann: "The beginning of the end"; "The great forgivness: life's martyr"; and "The twins." The brief memoirs appear to be written by twin sisters who survived Auschwitz-Birkenau and relate their experiences in Birkenau with Dr. Josef Mengele.
