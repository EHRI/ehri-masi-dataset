Anna Grun (born Schmidt or Gleitman) was born in Kraków, Poland. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Anna's family temporarily moved to Dąbrowa Tarnowska, Poland before returning to Kraków. While in the Kraków ghetto, her family went into hiding in an effort to escape deportations. In 1942, Anna was deported to Plaszów concentration camp and began working at Oskar Schindler's enamel factory. In 1944, Anna was deported to Auschwitz with a group of women who also worked for Schindler and continued working in the factory. After the liberation of Auschwitz in 1945, Anna and her sister returned to Kraków before Anna immigrated to the United States with her husband and two children in 1962.

Anna Grun's manuscripts include one Polish and two English versions entitled, “Remembrance,” about Anna's childhood in Kraków, Poland, her experiences in the Kraków ghetto and Płaszów concentration camp, and working at Oskar Schindler's enamel factory.
