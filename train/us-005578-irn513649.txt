Nordhausen and Buchenwald liberation photographs

folder

1

Six photographs are taken of the situation at Buchenwald and Nordhausen camps upon liberation--photographs of barracks, of lines of corpses, of piles of bone, and of an inmate showing his tattoo. Two of the photographs have the words "Buchenwald Concentration Camp--not for publication" and "Nordhausen" written on them. One photograph is of what appears to be Jewish-American soldiers being led in prayer with Nazi flags flanking them. On the back of this photograph is written "Germany."
