<p>The materials in this collection were gathered by Ilse Murray neé Perl. It is uncertain when and under which circumstances she received the papers of acquainted Enid Fordham. Upon Ilse's passing, her grandchildren kept these materials and donated them to The Wiener Holocaust Library in 2022, as previously suggested by Ilse.</p>

<p>The youngest of three children of a Jewish-German family, Ilse Perl (1921-2010) was born in Bismarckhütte (Chorzów), Silesia, to Elise neé Nicklas and Selmar Perl. After her mother's early passing she was raised by her uncle Salo and his daughters Minna and Selma Schlesinger in Gleiwitz (Gliwice).</p><p>Upon moving to Berlin, Ilse gave birth to her son Klaus Perl (later Claus Nicholas Perl, 1938-2004). She trained as a nurse and worked in the Jewish Hospital Berlin. In 1942 she married Dagobert Lewin (later Bert Lewyn), a young metal worker whose parents had recently been deported.</p><p>Ilse, Claus and Dagobert went into hiding in 1943. They survived with the help of non-Jewish friends until a then pregnant Ilse and Claus were eventually caught. Both were brought to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in January 1945.</p><p>Shortly after liberation, Ilse gave birth to Gad Lewin, who died within a few months. Upon recovery, Ilse worked as secretary for the American Joint Distribution Committee in Bergen-Belsen DP Camp. She and Claus befriended British Red Cross workers Irene England and Enid Fordham, Jewish Relief Unit officer Alice Redlich and survivor Hans (John) Fink, and future politician Greville Janner. </p><p>Ilse and Dagobert divorced in 1947, and Ilse married British soldier Harold Murray with whom she moved to England that year. Claus stayed behind in a Jewish Children’s Home in Lüneburg at first but followed his mother in early 1949.</p><p>Upon settling with Harold in Greater London, Ilse worked as a stock records clerk. Claus served in the British Army and worked various jobs later on. He married and became a proud father of two.</p>
