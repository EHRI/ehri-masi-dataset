Hungary's Prime Minister speaks

Magyar Híradó 777. Béla Imrédy stands at the front of the room on a stage, behind a white podium. He is giving a speech (in Hungarian). Men (security?) stand in a line against the wall beneath him. There is a large audience listening to Imrédy’s speech. View from an upper level of the crowd, and the guards standing with flags on the side of the stage. Four men stand on the stage. The one on the far left holds a flag. Multiple microphones stand on the podium in front of Imrédy. Various shots of the audience and the guards standing on the stage, each with a flag topped by metal symbols. Imrédy continues giving his speech, taking glances at the paper in his hands. The guard stands in formation with hands at their sides on stage. View of the audience extending back through a large entryway. Symbol of a rearing horse in a large circle. CU of a man in the audience, camera focuses on the people seated behind him. Imrédy’s speech goes on and he shakes his right hand in the air, index finger extended. Men in the audience watch intently. Shot from above of Imrédy speaking, revealing two staircases on either side of the podium from which to enter and exit the stage. The guards stand neatly on stage. Imrédy continues with his speech, gesturing with his right hand. People in the audience clap for him. Men in the audience. Imrédy from the side. The room from above. Closer shot of Imrédy delivering his speech. The audience claps. Imrédy finishes his speech, raising his arms in the air. Everyone in the audience stands and claps for him, as Imrédy puts his hand across his chest and dips his head in a slight bow.
