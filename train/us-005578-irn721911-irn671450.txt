By the Ghetto Gate

A topical song about food smuggling in the Kovno ghetto, By the Ghetto Gate draws on the melody of the much-loved "Yiddish alphabet song," Oyfn pripetshik (At the Hearth). Lyricist Avrom Akselrod, a refugee who had fled Poland at the start of World War II, wrote a number of parodic verses in the ghetto. He was killed in July 1944, when German militiamen set fire to his underground hiding place.
