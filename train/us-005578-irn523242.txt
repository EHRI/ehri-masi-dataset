The papers consist of documents concerning two ships, the President Warfield and the City of Lowell. Included are documents and other correspondence between Louis Levin, Evelyn Levin's husband, representing the Potomac Shipwrecking Company from October 18, 1946, and the Chinese American Industrial Company, purchasers of the aforementioned ships. The bill of sale for the President Warfield (later known as the Exodus) is also part the collection as is an inventory from the U.S. Maritime Commission delivered to the Potomac Shipwrecking Company. Also included are additional correspondence from the Chinese American Industrial Company pertaining to the purchase of the ships, a Western Union telegram to the Potomac Shipwrecking Company notifying that the purchase order was accepted, and a newspaper article for the twentieth anniversary of the voyage of the Exodus. The Exodus was used for illegal immigration to Palestine, and on July 19, 1947, she came within 23 miles of Haifa carrying 4550 refugees. She was intercepted by the British, and all of the passengers were transferred to three British ships and returned to Europe.
