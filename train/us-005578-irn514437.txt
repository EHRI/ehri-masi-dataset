Julius Streicher was the founder of "Der Stürmer" and Gauleiter of Franconia. He was sentenced to death at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg. [Encyclopedia of the Holocaust. Vol. 3-4. New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, 1995, pp. 1788.]

Issue of Der Stürmer with the subtitle, Deutsches Wochenblatt zum Kampfe um die Wahrheit, [German weekly magazine in the struggle for truth.] Der Stürmer was a viciously anti-Jewish newspaper published by Julius Streicher, an early Nazi Party member, from 1923-1945 in Germany. The newspaper's frequent subtitle was "Die Juden sind unser Unglück!" [The Jews are our misfortune]. The paper thrived on scandal, and preferred sensational stories of Jews committing disgusting, evil acts. It was also infamous for its antisemitic cartoons. Streicher was arrested by the US Army in May 1945. He was tried by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, convicted, and executed per the ruling that his repeated articles calling for the annihilation of the Jewish race were a direct incitement to murder and a crime against humanity.
