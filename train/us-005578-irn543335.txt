The David Granat papers consists of materials relating to a May 1946 performance by members of the Jewish Ex-Concentration Camp Orchestra in Nuremberg, Germany. The Orchestra was composed of survivors of the Kovno ghetto and various Nazi camps, and the event was produced for a special concert for the war crimes prosecutors and staff. Also included is a photograph of what appears to be the orchestra in street clothes, as well as a photograph of the orchestra performing onstage dressed in striped prison uniforms. The front of the stage is lined with which is inscribed "Am Israel Hai" ("The Israel People Live)." Also includes a printed program for the event with the names and the photographs of all the members of the orchestra and the repertoire for the evening. The program consists of four excerpts from popular operas and seven contemporary songs, along with two songs from the Vilna Ghetto and folk songs. On the back of the program appear the printed lyrics of four of the performed songs. The orchestra was founded in Kaunas in 1941, shortly after the establishment of the ghetto in the city. Since the Nazi officials forced the orchestra members to perform for them, the members of the orchestra survived until the annihilation of the ghetto in June 1944. After the obliteration of the ghetto, the 35 orchestra members were moved to concentration camps. Only twelve members survived the war and they met again in St. Ottilien (at first the orchestra was called St. Ottilien Orchestra), Munich , June 1945. The orchestra continued its activity until 1949.
