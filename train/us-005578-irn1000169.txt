Socialist Youth parade

Informal shots of Socialist youth parade along cobbled city street; carrying signs: "Heutigen Tag zur wahl zu gehen" ["Go to the polls today."] Parade is mostly children, with some bicyclists alongside the marchers, and at the very end there are a man and a dog. Nice street scene. View down cobblestone street.
