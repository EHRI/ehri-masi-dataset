Dora grew up in the small town of Sighet in Northern Romania between the two World Wars. In May 1944 she was deported to Auschwitz along with most of the town's 10,000 Jewish inhabitants. She survived the ordeal, but her parents, two of her brothers, and some 40 members of her extended family perished in the gas chambers. Dora returned to Sighet, married her high-school sweetheart, built a career, and raised a family before emigrating to the West to be with her surviving brothers.

The diary was written by Dora Apsan immediately following her liberation from Weisswasser, an I.G. Farben forced labor factory. In the diary, Dora recounts her family's final days in the ghetto in Sighet (Sighetu MarmatÌ¦iei), Romania; their deportation and arrival in Auschwitz; and her liberation.
