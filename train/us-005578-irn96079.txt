This collection contains research materials collected by Dr. B.A. Sijes and his students at the University of Amsterdam: Thera de Graaf, Annemarie Kloosterman, Annelies Visser, Jos van Loenen and Gertjan van Setten. Materials relate the Nazi persecution of Roma and Sinti. Part of the collection contains interviews with Roma and Sinti. At the end of the 1960s, B.A. Sijes focused his research on Dutch Roma and Sinti, but was not able to work with the material collected through unforeseen circumstances, and asked five of his students to continue his work. As a result of this work, Dr. Sijes published a book in 1979: "Vervolging van zigeuners in Nederland 1940-1945."
