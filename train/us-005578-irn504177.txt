Fritz Flesch sent the 1939 letter to the L.M. Bickett Company of Elkhhorn, Wisconsin, seeking employment in the United States. It describes his and his family's plight as a Jew in post-Anschluss Vienna. Also includes a letter and curriculum vitae from his wife, Katharina, who was also seeking employment, and who at that time had immigrated to Britain, and was working as a house maid near London. The L.M. Bickett Company response reveals that he was not offered a job by this firm. The Fleschs' fates are unknown.
