Linz; Vienna

Hitler's motorcade drives through the streets of Linz. Spectators wave Nazi flags. Aerial shot of Hitler's car as it crosses a bridge decorated with large swastikas. Medium shot of a crowd of children waving flags. Another aerial shot reveals the huge crowds that have come to greet Hitler. 02:00:32 Shot of a flag in a forest setting. The camera pans down to reveal Hitler walking at the head of a large crowd, surrounded by spectators. He salutes a group of civilian men holding shovels. The crowd salutes and a group of men follow Hitler to some open railroad cars. Hitler shovels dirt into one of the cars. Another crowd shot is followed by a shot of trees as they are cut down. A small train moves slowly down the tracks. It is decorated with a swastika and the open cars are filled with dirt. This might be the groundbreaking of the Linz location of the Hermann Goering Werke. 02:01:41 Hitler reviews uniformed men on a different occasion, although the location is probably still Linz (as identified by an intertitle). One of the cameramen may be Walter Frentz. Hitler's motorcade on the street, surrounded by crowds.
