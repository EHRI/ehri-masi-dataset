Fritz Hippler's marriage ceremony

Fritz Hippler, the head of the film department in the Propaganda Ministry and director of Der ewige Jude (The Eternal Jew), gets out of a car with his bride and two men. Inside the registry office a man behind the desk greets them with a Hitler salute. The clerk or judge performs the marriage ceremony and Hippler and his wife sign documents. Smiling, they exit the building and depart in their car.
