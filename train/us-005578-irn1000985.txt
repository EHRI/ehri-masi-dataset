CNBC News interview with Benjamin Ferencz. Host: Boyd ? "A war crimes trial should be in Saddam's future." Ferencz argues that Saddam Hussein should be punished in an international court of law. However, he notes, without a system of international law and order, we cannot condemn an international crime.
