Ignacy Schwarzbart (1888–1961) was a prominent Polish Zionist, and one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish Government-in-Exile during the Second World War, along with Szmul Zygielbojm. Schwarzbart and Zygielbojm played key roles in highlighting reports of Nazi atrocities against Jews in occupied Poland. In 1942 Schwarzbart held a press conference in London alleging that 1 million Jewish people had already been killed. The figures were reported in the media but were treated sceptically by both the British and by some other Polish politicians.

The collection contains correspondence, notes, press clippings, articles, regulations, speeches, reports, and correspondence. Materials relate to the following subjects: Aid rendered by Schwarzbart to the Jewish emigrants and war refugees from Poland; Jewish emigration, editing of the Jewish newspaper “The Future” in France in 1940 and newspapers in other countries; and Schwartzbart’s activity in the National Council of the Republic of Poland in France during 1939-1940.
