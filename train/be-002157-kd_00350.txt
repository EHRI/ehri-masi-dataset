Give Them a Face (France) portrait collection. Collection

over 4,200 digitised images (photos)

This collection contains over 4,200 portraits of Jewish men, women and children from Belgium, whom have been deported from the French camps Drancy, Angers, Beaune-la-Rolande, Compi√®gne, Pithiviers and Lyon, to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Sobibor, Maidanek and Kaunas between March 1942 and August 1944. Among the deportees, four groups can be distinguished : persons that had lived in Belgium and whom had emigrated to France legally before the beginning of the war, persons that fled from Belgium to France in May 1940 or afterwards, children born out of these refugees in France and persons arrested by the Belgian state as "suspects" in May 1940 and deported to the camps in the South of France.
