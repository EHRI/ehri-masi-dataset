Hedwig (Hedi) Stern (née Eichengrün, later Gutmann, 1898-1983) was born on 29 April 1898 in Munich, Germany to Sally (1867-1948) and Julie (née Heumann, 1874-1936) Eichengrün. She had one brother, Frederick (Fritz, Fred, 1903-1980). Sally owned a textile and fashion company called S. Eichengrün and Company. Sally later married Alice Lissauer (1896-1947) after Julie’s death in 1936. Hedi married Franz Gutmann, a doctor, in February 1921 and they had three children: Elisabeth (Ellie, later Elisabeth Schnitzer, 1922-1996), Marianne (later Marianne Gutmann Lee, 1924-2004?), and Herbert Michael (1929-2015?). Hedwig and Franz divorced in 1929, and she married Fritz Stern in 1930. Frederick (Fritz) Stern (1888-1955) was the son of Carolina (née Ney, 1864-1933) and Isaac Stern (1859-1894). He had one brother, Karl (d. 1934, married to Carry Gerst). Fritz was a doctor and also involved with the Jewish Cultural Community (der Israelischen Kultusgemeinde). He had two children, Walter (1926-1945) and Gertrude (nicknamed Gertie, later known Judith Stern Siegel, 1929-1992), with his first wife Hedwig Neumeyer (1899-1929). Fritz and Hedi’s daughter Eva (later Eva Silver, 1931-2009) was born in 1931. In 1933 Hedi and Fritz planned to immigrate to Palestine. They purchased property there, but ultimately decided that they would rather immigrate to the United States. In 1936 they sent their three oldest children to Switzerland to attend a Jewish school while they prepared to emigrate from Germany. The night before they planned to leave Munich, Fritz had his passport confiscated by two policemen. It was returned to him two days later and they went to Hamburg. They were to leave on 22 November 1936, but prior Fritz was warned by his attorney that if they boarded the ship they would have been arrested. They finally sailed from Hamburg in December aboard the SS Washington, arriving in New York on 8 January 1937. They went to Berkeley, California to where they had friends. Six months later they moved to Pasadena. Fritz opened the Alhambra Camera shop in Alhambra. In 1944, Walter was drafted into the United States Army. He was killed in the European theatre on 14 April 1945, and posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. After the Sterns arrived in the United States, they worked to help Hedi’s father and his second wife Alice immigrate to the United States. While they were unsuccessful, Sally and Alice managed to flee Germany in November 1939 to Orselina, Switzerland where they remained for the duration of the war. Eva Stern married Gerald Silber (Silver), who was also a German Jewish refugee. They had two daughters, Deborah (b. 1961) and Judith (b. 1963).
