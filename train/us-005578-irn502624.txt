Contains a testimony in letter form written by Carl P. Keiser on March 28, 1981, concerning his liberation experiences in the area of Gars am Inn, Germany. Keiser describes the liberation of a small concentration camp in the Gars am Inn area, which he refers to as "a penal branch of a large camp at Mühldorf some 20 km to the East." (The International Tracing Service list of camps notes a subcamp of Mühldorf known as "Mittegars." Mühldorf was, in turn, a subcamp of Dachau.) In addition, Keiser describes the physical aspects of the small camp, the discovery of a mass grave at the camp, and autopsies performed on the bodies of victims by doctors of the "War Crimes Commission."
