Alice Lang Rosen was born in 1934 in Lambsheim, Germany. When she was 6 years old, her family was deported to the Gurs concentration camp in France and then to Rivesaltes, another concentration camp in France. The French Red Cross took her out of the camp and hid her from the Germans by placing her in a children's home, then in a convent, and then with various Catholic families. After liberation, she was sent to a children's home near Paris, France, where a rabbi was gathering Jewish children from all over France. Her father traced her, and in 1946 they were reunited in Germany. They immigrated to the United States in 1949.
