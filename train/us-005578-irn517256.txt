Wilfred "Bill" Kay (also known as Szlomo Katz, 1928 or 1930-2016) was born Szlomo Katz in Pu≈Çtusk, Poland. When WW II broke out, he and his parents and six siblings fled their home. His entire family perished in the Holocaust. Wilfred survived, spent several years in a displaced persons camp, and immigrated to the United States in 1949.

The letter written by Joseph E. White, Chief Engineer/USAT "General R.L. Howe," recommends "Katz Solomon" [donor] as a "good and willing worker." White and Katz worked together bringing displaced persons from Bremerhaven, Germany, to New Orleans, LA.
