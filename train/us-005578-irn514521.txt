Carl Gärting, who was not Jewish, was arrested in 1935 for treasonous activities including publishing and distributing anti-Nazi material. He was imprisoned at Kassel, Germany from 1935-1938, and in Buchenwald concentration camp from 1938 until its liberation in April 1945. While in Buchenwald, Gärting worked as a baker in the camp and supported other prisoners by sneaking food and other items to them.
