Badkhn repertory of Simcha Friedman

Survivor and "Schindler Jew" Carl Freedman recorded a selection of the repertoire of his father, Simcha Friedman, a cantor and badkhn (wedding entertainer) from Krakow, who did not survive the war. Carl is accompanied on the recording by his accordionist brother, Moishe. The recording is important in that it preserves topical songs from the mostly-lost tradition of Galician wedding entertainers; it includes as well at least one topical song reflective of the war, and probably created postwar.
