The Jewish businessman ('Kaufmann') and property owner, Josef Georg Altmann, died in Frankfurt in 1934 and left a substantial estate behind, which was primarily located in Poland. The heirs included his wife and their four children: Richard, Hans, Manfred and Lotte. Richard Altmann emigrated to Cairo in the late 1930s and Hans ('Jan') Altmann (1895-1980) emigrated to England in 1938. Manfred Altmann (1900-1954), a general practitioner, emigrated to London in 1933 and was followed by his wife Hannah (1898-1954), a medical professional, and their daughter Eva (born 1929) in the same year. Lotte Altmann (1908-1942) also emigrated to London in 1933 and soon worked as a private secretary for Stefan Zweig (1881-1942) who she later married.
