Miriam and Israel Eskenazi immigrated to the United States from Salonika, Greece around 1917. Eli and Lena Eskenazi were born in the United States prior to 1922. The family returned to Salonika around 1922, where Sylvia and Emmanuel were born. In the spring 1943, the family was part of a larger round up in Salonica. Miriam, Israel, Sylvania, and Emmanuel Eskenazi were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where they perished. Since Lena and Eli Eskenazi were American citizens, they were sent instead to Vittel internment camp in France. Lena was released in 1943 and returned to New York.
