Schlesinger Hostel: papers

1 Box

The archive was discovered by one of the Schlesinger's own children who then handed it to one of the hostel children.

The founders of the hostel were Bernard Schlesinger, a prominent pediatrician and his wife, Winifred. They were concerned about the increasingly desperate situation for Jews in Germany and wanted to establish a safe haven for 12 Jewish children from Berlin.

This collection comprises original papers and correspondence which documents the establishment and maintenance of a refugee children's hostel in Highgate, London, 1938-1939. The papers offer a valuable insight into the processes and issues relating to such an enterprise. <br><br>Two of the former children produced a documentary reader comprising copies and translations of much of the material in the archive (1625/1). It also includes copies of documents from Ilse Jacobsohn's (later Ilse Henry) own file. The personal files of the other children are not open to the public.
