The Position of the Jews in Germany (October)

1 electronic resource (30 pages)

The file contains a report of 1937 about the position of Jews in Germany written in German. The Jewish Central information Office published every month a new report, regarding the situation of Jews in Germany. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). This report is devided into 4 chapters "The general situation", "The position of the Jews in the German industry and in Business", "The position in different districts" and "The yellow Badge". The situationof Jews is getting constantly worse, as the National Socialism aims the total economic and moral destruction of the 375.000 Jews, who are still living in Germany, so the author argues. In view of all these circumstances the emigration of Jews from Germany continued to develope during the year 1937 as well as the number of suicides. A scientific work is discussed in this report which is saying that comparing the years 1924-26 with the years of 1932-34 the number of suicides of Jews in Berlin had increased by about 50%. Also the exclusion from professions was continuing in 1937. Furthermore a much read Paris newspaper in has reported, that the 'Yellow Badge' was going to be reintroduced in Germany for Jews.
