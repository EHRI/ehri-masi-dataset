Correspondence with Callaghan, James

28 letters

Leonard James Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff (1912-2005) served as the UK's Prime Minister between 1976 and 1979. His political career had started in 1945, when he was elected to the House of Commons. He was appointed parliament secretary in the Ministry of Transport, Chancellor of Exchequer, Minister of Interior, Foreign Minister and finally Prime Minister. After resigning as head of the Labour Party and later from the House of Commons, he was made life peer and entered the House of Lords in 1987. Callaghan also served as board member of the Wiener Library from 1946-49. See Conroy, H., , Haus Publishing, 2006.

The correspondence throws light on Callaghan’s activities to support The Wiener Library. This includes among others the approach of several MPs; the backing of the Library’s efforts to gain access to restricted records; an attempt to procure Eva Reichmann a lecture in the Committee of Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons; the writing of an article for the Library’s Bulletin. Beside letters, the correspondence contains an undated German language memo of a meeting Callaghan’s with Alfred Wiener (probably 1949).
