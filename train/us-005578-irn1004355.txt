Clip from the propaganda film about the 1934 Reich Party Day

An aerial shot of the Luitpold Arena shows three men walking between rows and rows of men standing in formation. They are walking in the direction of the Hall of Honor. A slow panning shot from behind the columns at the front shows a band playing and reveals the three men to be Hitler, Himmler, and Viktor Lutze, who took over as top SA man after the murder of Ernst Roehm. They stop before a huge wreath in front of the memorial, which served the Nazis as a memorial to those Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch.
