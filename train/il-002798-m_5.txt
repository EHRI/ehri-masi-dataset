198 Files

Most of the documentation that was collected by the The Documentation Center of the Central Union of Jewish Communities in Bratislava  was submitted to Yad Vashem in 1954.

The Documentation Center of the Central Union of Jewish Communities in Bratislava was founded following the liberation of Czechoslovakia at the initiative of the Jewish Agency for Eretz Israel, the Zionist Federation and the Association of Jewish Communities in Slovakia.

The purpose of the Documentation Center was to collect documentation regarding the Jews of Slovakia during the Holocaust and record their experiences.  Towards the end of their activities in 1949, the Documentation Center published the book, "The Holocaust of the Jews of Slovakia- Pictures and Documents", edited by Dr. Bedrich Steiner.

There are 190 files in the Record Group including documentation from the Jewish Center, Slovakian institutions that were involved in the persecution of the Jews, the Nazi party in Slovakia, anti-Jewish legislation and decrees, documentation regarding forced labor camps, documentation of trials against Nazi criminals and more.
