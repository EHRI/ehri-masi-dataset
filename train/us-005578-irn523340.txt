Yakov Neuman papers

oversize box

1

Contains two notebooks, handwritten and hardbound. The notebooks were written in displaced persons camps in Germany and Cyprus by three rabbis (sometimes the rabbinate from Stuttgart is used). The notebooks contain notes on permits for "agunot" (women whose husbands had disappeared or who had died without witnesses, and men who could not prove that they are single or widowed) to marry and a list of names of women who are permitted to marry. The notebooks also contain testimonies of survivors regarding the circomstances surrounding the death of the above mentioned spouses. Each notebook contains 160-170 pages with handwritten notes; some documents (such as telegrams) are inserted between pages.
