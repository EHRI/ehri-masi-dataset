Consists of one memoir, 82 pages, entitled "Waves, A Memoir, 1929-1950," by Dr. Julius J. Menn, originally of Langfuhr, near Danzig (Gdansk), Poland. Dr. Menn describes his childhood, his family's immigration to Palestine in 1935, their journey back to Poland in 1938 (as his mother did not adjust well to Palestine), first to visit family in Vilna, and then to settle in Warsaw. He recalls Polish antisemitism, the invasion of Poland, and fleeing east, first to Molodechno, and then to Vilna. In 1940, the family was able to travel from Odessa to Tel Aviv, and remained in Palestine during the Holocaust. He describes life in Palestine, his memories of the assassination of Abraham Stern, his bar mitzvah, and air raids. After the war, he lived on a kibbutz from 1945-1946, before becoming a Haganah officer. In 1947, he immigrated to the United States to study in San Francisco, but returned to Israel in 1948, to fight in the War of Independence as a member of the medical corps. He returned to California and received his PhD at Berkeley.
