Belgian volunteers enlisting for Germany

Belgian volunteers enlist to fight the Soviets on the side of the Germans. Men stand outside a building with a big sign that reads "Wallonie pour la lutte contre le Bolschevisme". They look at a poster on the building. Inside the building, men hand over their identity cards to a clerk, who records their information.
