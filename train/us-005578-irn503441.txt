Winfield Rosenberg, a native of Lititz, PA, was a private in the United States Army assigned to the 106th Infantry Division during World War II. Initially, the United States War Department notified his parents the he was missing-in-action (MIA) on 16 Dec. 1944. In Mar. 1945, the War Department again notified his next-of-kin that he had became a prisoner of war during the "Battle of the Bulge." He was sent to Stalag IX-B at Bad Orb, Germany. Rosenberg said that in Feb. 1945 the commandant of the camp ordered "all American prisoners who were Jewish were to report to a certain barracks." What followed for Rosenberg and 349 other American prisoners of war was a transfer to Berga am Elster, a Buchenwald subcamp. At Berga, they were assigned to work in the mines. Allegedly, the SS guards deliberately starved them. Rosenberg was eventually liberated from a German hospital by units of the 90th Infantry Division. He lives in Lewes, Dela.

Relates to Winfield Rosenberg's experience and the experiences of some of his American Jewish comrades at Stalag IX-B, Bad Orb, Germany, and at Berga an der Elster, a Buchenwald subcamp. There also is some information about a death march involving Rosenberg and other American prisoners of war, and their subsequent liberation by the 90th Infantry Division.
