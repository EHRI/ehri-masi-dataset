Berlin Olympics 1936

A clip from Leni Riefenstahl's film "Fest der Schönheit." "Fest der Schönheit" [Festival of Beauty] was the subtitle of part two of Riefenstahl's film "Olympia" about the 1936 Berlin Olympics. An on-screen title which precedes this footage of the women's gymnastics competition indicates that this clip was distributed by a company called Degeto. The footage shows women from different nations competing on the pommel horse (in slow-motion), the balance beam and the parallel bars. Many of the shots are from below and in close-up. There are also shots of the German team carrying the Nazi flag down a grassy hill, and the stadium full of spectators.
