Contains documents and a photograph related to Ida Weiss, including a document issued to her in May 1949 in Vienna, Austria, stating that she had been born 11 August 1879, was deported to Minsk on 25 June 1942, and her card never appeared in the Vienna Jewish Organization return card files; and a letter written by Ida to her daughter Lilly, June 1942, Vienna, Austria, on the day before Ida was deported. The text of the letter reads: "My dearest Lilly! Pay balance of gas and electric bill, whatever they amount to. I gave uncle Max 20 marks - he should refund it to you. Small comforter - please keep it. Take the remaining dresses and hats and food, whatever you can use. They are in the cupboard. Give to uncle Lutschi our father's winter coat. He should keep it. My dear good child fare well. May G-d grant us that we see each other again. Kiss Otto (Lilly's husband) for me, and I kiss you a thousand times - your sad mother."
