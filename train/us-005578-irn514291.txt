Hedwig Schwarz was born on Mar. 23, 1887 in Rexingen, Germany, the daughter of Seligmann Schwarz and Ernestine Frohlich Schwarz. On Aug. 19, 1942, she and her husband Louis Schwarz, along with the remaining Jews in Rexingen (including her brother-in-law and sister, Berthold and Cilie Schwarz Neckarsulmer) were put on a transport destined for Theresienstadt via Stuttgart. Along the way, Hedwig was removed from the train and taken to a hospital, where she was cared for until the end of the war, then transferred to the Marien Hospital where she spent her final days. Her husband, Louis, perished in Theresienstadt on Jan. 19, 1944, and her widowed daughter, Hilde Schwarz Lemberger, and grandson, Siegfried (Friederle), who were deported east on Nov. 28, 1941, perished in the Riga concentration camp.

Collection consists of correspondence by Hedwig Schwarz in the last days of her life, from a Marian Hospital in Stuttgart. It also contains nine photographs of Mrs. Schwarz in her hospital bed and the eulogy and correspondence written after her death. Mrs. Schwarz was one of three survivors of Rexingen and spent the last years of the war through her death in 1952, at the Marian Hospital in Stuttgart.
