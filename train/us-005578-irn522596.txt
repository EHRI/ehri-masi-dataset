Max Unger was born in New York on November 29, 1866 and died in Berlin, Germany in 1912. His son, Georg Unger was born in Berlin on October 6, 1897. He was a businessman. In 1938 he wrote to possible distant relatives in the United States requesting assistance to emigrate from Germany.

The Georg Unger letter, dated 12 November 1938, was sent from Georg Unger in Berlin, Germany to Henry Unger in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the letter, Georg explains that he and Henry Unger could be distantly related, but regardless, he needs an affidavit of support in order to emigrate from Germany, as he is no longer allowed to work under Nazi restrictions. Also included is the envelope in which the letter was mailed.
