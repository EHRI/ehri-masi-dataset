The typed letter was sent to Sheva Zilberberg by Monika Janecka, a Polish woman from Da̜brówki, Poland, in which she says that she is sending negatives of photos taken there so that some girls can be identified and is also sending an image of the town so that Sheva can show her husband where she was forced to live and work. Ms. Janecka advises Sheva that as a newlywed she should keep up her strength and not think about the past because nothing will bring back the dead.
