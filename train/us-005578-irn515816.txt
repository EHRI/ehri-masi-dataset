Eva Young (née Miodelska) was born on 1926 October 27 in Lipsko, Poland to Israel and Zelda Mieodelska. She had one sister, Tina, and two brothers, Moshe and Vanhil. Her father was a businessman. In 1942 Eva was deported to the Skarżysko-Kamienna forced-labor camp. She fled the camp to return to Lipsko, but was found by the Germans and sent to Majdanek and then back to Skarżysko-Kamienna. In 1944 she was sent to the Krups factory in Leipzig, Germany. In April 1945 she was sent on a death march. She ran away and found shelter with a man who hid her and three other Jewish girls. They were then liberated by Soviet soldiers, who initially mistook them for spies. After the war, Eva went to the Netherlands and then France. She immigrated to Palestine in March 1946. She got married and had two children, and the family immigrated to the United States in 1959. Her parents were likely deported to Treblinka in 1942 where they perished.

The collection consists of two studio portraits of Eva Young (née Miodelska), originally of Lipsko, Poland taken in 1945 (one in Holland and one in France), and one studio portrait of a man and woman.
