1,11 linear metres, paper

The records of the Chief Constables’ offices in Heves County were handed over by the County Council to the Heves County State Archives and its successors during the late1950s.

Headed by chief constables (főszolgabírók), districts were the basic administrative bodies of the counties in Hungary and the authority of first instance in the provinces. Districts already existed in medieval Hungary, but as modern-era administrative units they were created by Act XXI of 1886 (modified by Act XXX of 1929). Each district engulfed several villages (municipalities), the administration of which was subordinated to the chief constable. Besides, chief constables also supervised gendarmerie, the law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining order and persecuting crime in the districts. After World War II, chief constables’ offices were renamed chief notaries' offices, and in 1950 they were replaced by district councils.

The majority of the records of the Tiszafüred administrative district from the period 1938-1945 were lost or destroyed. The relevant parts that remained include the fragments of presidential and mobilization records that hold information on administrative measures against non-resident aliens and foreigners, internment and custody, registration, expulsion of Jews, supervision of Jewish organizations and institutions, military labour service, citizenship cases, implementation of anti-Jewish laws and decrees, the supervision and activities of extreme right-wing political parties and organizations in the localities of the district.
