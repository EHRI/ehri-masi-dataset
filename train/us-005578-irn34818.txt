Consists of eleven photographs, some possibly taken by Raymond C. Regan, Sr., a member of the 104th Infantry Division (Timberwolves). Eight photographs depict corpses found upon the liberation of the Nordhausen concentration camp and are most likely mass-produced photographs. Three photos, possibly taken by Mr. Regan, were originally described by him as "D.P. trains arriving at Eilenburg with Russ[ians] and Poles," and show what are believed to be trains carrying repatriated displaced persons.
