Abraham Getman (1926-2011) was born in Luboml, Poland on 21 July, 1926, to parents Shmuel (1889-1941) and Miriam (n√©e Zuckerman, 1895-1942?) Hetman (the family surname later changed to Getman under Russian occupation). He had four brothers, Yakov (b. 1916-1973), Moshe (b. 1922-1941), Chaim (b. 1924-41?), and Leibel (b. 1930-1944?), and a sister, Fayga (b. 1920-1942?). In the course of the German occupation of Luboml many members of the Hetman family were killed. Abraham, having escaped from the Luboml ghetto in 1942, survived in hiding before finding himself interned in the Murafa ghetto in Transnistria. He was liberated there by the Soviet Army in March 1944. By summer 1946 Abraham had arrived in Austria where he lived as a displaced person, first in the DP camp of St. Marien, and later in Admont. By 1948 Abraham had moved to Israel where he served in the IDF (Israel Defense Forces). In Palestine Abraham reunited with his eldest brother, Yakov, who had left Poland in the mid 1930s. Abraham and Yakov were the only members of their immediate family to survive the Holocaust.
