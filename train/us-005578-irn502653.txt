folder

1

Contains a questionnaire, copies of an article, and two letters concerning the experiences of William Pierce at the liberation of a labor camp and a camp near Neumarkt, Germany, and another camp near Wels, Austria. (The later camp, which he does not name, may have been Gunskirchen or Wels II, both subcamps of Mauthausen.) The article describes the scene at Neumarkt upon liberation, the diet of the slave laborers, and the type of labor the prisoners performed.
