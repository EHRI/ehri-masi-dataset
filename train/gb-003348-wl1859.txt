1 folder

Orphaned at a young age, August Frank was brought up by his uncle, a teacher. He was a keen musician, who was persuaded to study law and became a public prosecutor in Augsburg and later a high court judge in Munich. He went to universities at Munich, Berlin and WÃ¼rzburg and continued his interest in piano and the violin. He met his wife, Valerie Goldschmidt, through their shared interest in music. When Jews were barred from attending musical concerts August Frank became the first violin in the newly founded Jewish community orchestra. This was  a relatively affluent, assimilated Jewish family who were only nominally observant.<div><br><div>The daughter (and depositor), Alice Frank, went to private school initially with (amongst others)Thomas Mann's son, Michael, then later to a gymnasium until aged 16 (in 1934) when the family were persuaded to send her away to Switzerland to complete her education (in English). Her brother had already made a visit to England wher he decided he wanted to remain. Alice came to England in 1937 and enrolled in a course at a secretarial college and the parents came out just before the outbreak of war.
