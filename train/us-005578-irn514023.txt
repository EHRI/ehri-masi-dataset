Bronia Bratt Landau (1926-2008) was born on Feb. 4, 1926, in Kromołów, Poland to Abraham and Rachel Bratt. She had three brothers and one sister, Malka. After the German invasion, her father and brothers were sent to concentration camps by 1941. In 1942, Bronia was sent to the Stalag Luft III prisoner-of-war camp in Sagan, Germany (now Żagań, Poland), where she worked in a textile factory. In 1942, she was transported to the Grünberg subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where she was imprisoned until 1945. Due to the approaching Russian army, she was sent on a death march from Grünberg to the Helmbrechts subcamp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp in January 1945. In April 1945, the death march resumed in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, and Bronia sustained a severe head wound. In Wilkenau, she managed to escape. Through the kindness of those she encountered, she survived, kept her Jewish identity a secret, and found employment at a nursing home in Ronsberg until the liberation of Germany.

The collection consists of two copies (one each in English and Hebrew), of "My Lost Childhood", a memoir by Bronia Bratt Landau, originally of Kromołów, Poland, which details her experiences between 1942-1945 in the Stalag Luft III prisoner-of-war camp in Sagan, Germany (now Żagań, Poland), the Grünberg subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp, and the Helmbrechts subcamp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp. The memoir also discusses her escape from a death march in German-occupied Czechoslovakia in 1945. Also included are two copies of a photograph of the Bratt family from 1941. Both copies are annotated on the verso.
