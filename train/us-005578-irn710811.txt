Henriette Bick Hahn was born Henriette Hick on 11 June 1923 in Munich, Germany to Karl and Emma Bick. Her father Karl (1878-1940) was Jewish and worked as a jewelry salesman. Her mother Emma (née Mutzbauer, b. 1879) was Catholic and worked as a seamstress. They married in 1909 and had 12 children, six of whom died in childhood. Several of Henriette’s siblings immigrated to the United States before World War II. During Kristallnacht in November 1938, Karl was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Stadelheim prison before being deported to Dachau on 25 November 1938. He perished in the camp in 1940. After the start of the war Henriette was a forced-laborer in a fabric factory. After the war, she and her mother Emma immigrated to the United States in 1947 where several of her siblings lived. Henriette met her husband in Queens and they had four children.
