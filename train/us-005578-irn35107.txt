Simone Brand Birndorf (born Simonka Brand) was born in 1938 in Łódź, Poland to Stefzca and Izak Brand. At the age of three, Simone was sent to live with her paternal uncle, Felix Brand, and his wife Irka Brand, who were living in Poland under falsified papers. Her parents perished in the Holocaust. After the war, the Brand family, with Simone’s surviving paternal grandmother lived in the Zeilsheim Displaced Persons Camp in Germany before immigrating to Israel and later Canada. Simone Brand married Harold Birndoft (d. 2018), and they had three children.

The Simone Brand Birndorf photograph collection consists of black and white photographic prints of members of the Brand family of Łódź, Poland, taken before and after World War II.
