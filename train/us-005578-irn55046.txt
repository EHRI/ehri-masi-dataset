Josef Burger (later Joseph, 1919-1992) was born in 1919 in Vienna, Austria to Solomon and his wife. He had three siblings: Herman, Alfred, and Steffi. Steffi went to England on the Kindertransport. Alfred also went to England, but was arrested as an enemy alien and sent on the HMT Dunera to Australia, where he was interned in the Hay and Tatura camps before his release and return to England. Herman was in Trieste, Italy and then deported and perished during the war. Solomon fled to France and was sent to Rivesaltes transit camp before being deported to Auschwitz where he was killed. Joseph fled Vienna, stopping briefly in Zurich, Switzerland and Denmark before being held in the Merksplas internment camp in Belgium. He immigrated to the United States in March 1940. Josef later married Hannah (1920-2009) and had three children.
