Consists of one memoir, 98 pages, entitled "My Story," by Margaret Elias Lawrence, who was born in Munich, Germany, in 1917. She was raised in KÃ¶nigsberg, Germany, where her father, Leo Elias, owned a small store. She recalls her childhood, the increasing antisemitism after 1933, Kristallnacht, and her immigration to England in February 1939, to work as household help. She married fellow refugee Hans George Lewinneck (Harold George Lawrence) in January 1940, and in February 1945, Margaret gave birth to a son, Peter. In 1948, the family immigrated to Argentina, and then to the United States in 1954, settling in California. Also includes two pre-World War I photographs taken of Leo Elias's store in Munich.
