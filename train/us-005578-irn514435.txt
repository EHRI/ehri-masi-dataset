Contains one memoir, 21 pages, detailing the pre-war, wartime, and post-war experiences of Helga Stein. As the only child of an Aryan father (who passed away when she was three) and a Jewish mother, she details her experiences in Berlin as a child under the Nazi regime. After her family and friends were arrested and deported, Mrs. Stein, then a young adult, hid in a bombed out apartment building in Berlin for the entirety of the war. She immigrated to the United States in 1953.
