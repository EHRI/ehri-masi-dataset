Archives d√©partementales de la Somme

This collection contains reports from the police on the population, records on strikes, sentences punishing anti-patriotic or anti-governmental activities and political parties or organizations, the press, records on youth movements, propaganda, associations and clubs, the general morale of the population; and lists of Jews living in the Somme. Contains also records on the attribution of Aryan administrators for Jewish businesses and property, deportation lists of Jews, Roma and resistance fighters. There were four places where people were interned: the Camp of the Citadel of Amiens (probably for collaborationists), the Camp of the Citadel of Doullens (a forced-labor camp), the Camp of Abbeville, and the Prison of Amiens.
