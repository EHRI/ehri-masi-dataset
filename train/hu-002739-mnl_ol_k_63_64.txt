The study of the Political Deparment of the Foreign Ministry with its general and confidential parts enables a grasp of the development of independent Hungarian diplomacy after the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, the guiding ideas and leading actions of foreign policy, and the evolution of the relationship between Hungary and other countries. The Political Department was responsible for the practical implementation of foreign policy plans. The collection contains selected records relating to Hungarian foreign relations and policies, many of which are relevant for the study of the history of the Holocaust. These documents include reports submitted by Hungarian diplomatic missions in the cities of Arad, Bucharest, and Brasov in Romania to the Foreign Ministry in Budapest about incidents concerning Jews in 1944, the speech Catholic priest Áron Márton held at St. Michael's Church in May 1944 in which he explicitly condemned the deportation of Jewry in preparation. There are also relevant Hungarian German press articles and clippings in the collection.
