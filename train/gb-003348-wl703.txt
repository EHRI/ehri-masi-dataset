Nothing is known about the provenance

This letter, written by a member of a <em>Waffen SS Veterinär Ersatzkompanie</em> in Radan, Poland, offers a rare insight into the experiences of a rank and file member of an SS company. The letter is particularly noteworthy for the way in which the author expresses regret for having missed taking part in an action in which 3 Polish villages were raided and a great number of Poles were shot. Unfortunately the location of Radan is not known. It is therefore not possible to place the letter in its precise historical context.<br /><br />The letter is written in Sütterlin script.
