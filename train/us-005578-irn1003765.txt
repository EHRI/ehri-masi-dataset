Training film for German sharpshooters

First title slate: "Oberkommando Des Heeres Chef des Ausbildungswesens im Ersatzheer Abteilung Lehrfilm in Zusammenarbeit mit Generalstab des Heeres Ausbildungsabteilung zeigt: Lehrfilm Nr. 468 hergestellt Fruehjahr 1944" "Scharfschuetze im Einsatz" [Sharpshooters in action] Next slate: "Die im Film gezeigten Entfernungen entsprechen zum Teil nicht der Wirklichkeit. Sie sind durch film technische Notwendigkeiten bedingt." [warning that some scenes in the film are recreations]. Title slate: "Die Unsichtbare Waffe" [The Invisible Weapon]. An obviously staged scene of soldiers in a forest setting. The sound is incorrectly synched. One of the soldiers hides among the trees wearing a helmet covered with leaves. Another soldier tells the first to better camouflage himself and his weapon. Another soldier blows a whistle and announces a rest break, which the soldiers enjoy by sitting in the sun and smoking cigarettes. One of the soldiers states that he thought becoming a sharpshooter would be easier and more exciting. Another tells a story, shown in a flashback, of how he sneaked up behind and killed three Soviet snipers. He is shown camouflaging his face and crawling through the grass wearing a camouflage suit. One of the Soviet snipers is Asian. The scene comes back to the group of soldiers taking their break. Another soldier begins to tell a story but at this point the reel ends.
