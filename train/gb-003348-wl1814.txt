2 folders

Wigdor Hersch Eisenthal ('Hermann'; 1882-1948) was originally from Kossow, Austrian Hungarian Empire (now Ukraine). He was brought up in the Jewish Orthodox faith. Hermann served in the First World War and received two silver medals in honour for his services. He moved to Vienna shortly after the war and worked as a wholesale drapery merchant. In 1921 he got married to Stella Eisenthal (1888-1936) from Vienna. She was educated at a finishing school for girls until she was about 20 years old, which was unusual at the time. They had two children: Ilse (born in 1922) and Herbert (born in 1924). In the early 1930s Hermann Eisenthal gave up his business and became a travelling salesman. This became increasingly difficult as a war wound started affecting his eyesight. Hermann was a member of the Socialist party and the local Zionist group.&nbsp;<div><span style="line-height: 1.22;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.22;">After the annexation of Austria, Hermann Eisenthal lost his assets and the financial situation became increasingly difficult. His wife had died in 1936 but he had to continue supporting his two children. Herbert was allowed to attend his school until July 1938 when he had to transfer due to new Nazi legislation. Shortly after the November pogroms Hermann took his son to the local Jewish Community Centre which arranged for Herbert's emigration on a Kindertransport to England. He left Vienna in December 1938. His sister went to Palestine in July 1939 but never fully recovered from her traumatic experiences in Vienna. Herbert initially stayed at a holiday camp in Dovercourt and was later moved to Ipswich where boys and girls were separated. He was then transferred to a family in Preston, where he started grammar school. Between 1941 and 1945 Herbert Eisenthal trained as an electrical engineer at the Union of Lancashire and Cheshire Institutes, the City &nbsp;and Guilds of London Institute and later at Manchester Municipal College of Technology. He got married to Louise Moss of Manchester in 1952.</span></div><br /><div>Herbert's father stayed behind in Vienna. He was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp in July 1942. He survived and was liberated in May 1945. Hermann Eisenthal then went to the displaced persons camp Deggendorf where he stayed until he received his permit to emigrate to Palestine. He died in Jerusalem in 1948.</div>
