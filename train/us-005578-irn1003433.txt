Memorial to police

Title on screen: "Ein Ehrenmal der Polizei auf dem Horst Wessel-Platz in Berlin enthuellt. Unweit dieser Stelle wurden vor drei Jahren die Polizei Hauptleute Anlauf und Lenk von Kommunisten ermordert. [The unveiling of a memorial to the police on the Horst Wessel Plazt in Berlin. Three years ago the police captains Anlauf and Lenk were murdered by communists]." A policeman stands and speaks at a flag-draped podium. He salutes at the end of his speech. The crowd salutes as the memorial is uncovered. Members of the military march past the memorial. Good shots of police in uniform, including close-ups. Anlauf and Lenk were killed in August 1931 at a communist demonstration in Berlin's Buelowplatz. One of the alleged accomplices to the crime was Erich Mielke, who fled to the Soviet Union and much later became the last Stasi chief of East Germany. He was sentenced to six years in prison for the murders in 1993.
