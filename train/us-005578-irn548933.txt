The Szamek family resided in Budapest, Hungary. Rosalia Rosenberg was born on May 16, 1870 in Pozsony, Hungary. In 1890, she married an artist named Isidor Rosenberg. Their daughter Mariska (Mary) Rosenberg was born on November 20, 1891. Shortly after his daughter’s birth, Isidor died. By 1892 Rosalia remarried another artist named Isidore Szamek, who specialized in creating stained glass windows and murals for public buildings. Together they had eight children: Berta (b. May 28, 1895), Sari (b. March 7, 1897), Juliska (b. April 11, 1899), Elizabeth (Bozsi, b. February 4, 1901), Ethel (b. September 3, 1903), Jolan (b. February 8, 1906), Llonka (b. March 3, 1909), and Laszlo (b. October 14, 1914). On December 31, 1911 Mariska (Mary) Rosenberg marries Janos Juhasz. Their only son died at the age of three months. Afterwards, Mariska left Janos, who was a womanizer and alcoholic, and returned to living with her parents. In 1914, Mariska changed her name to Mary and immigrated to the United States. Mary Rosenberg arrived in New York on June 15, 1914. She obtained a divorce from Janos via proxy and on April 18, 1921 she married Martin Kepesh (born Kepecs). Martin was born on December 28, 1883 in Kisulak, Hungary. Mary had agreed to marry Kepesh after he promised to assist her sisters in immigrating to the United States. A year into their marriage, he reneged on his promise and as a result several of her family members were caught up in the Holocaust. In 1925, their daughter, Fannie Hermina Kepesh was born. Fannie later legally changed her name to Faye Baron. The fate of the extended Szamek family is largely unknown. Prior to the war, Berta Szamek had a daughter Emma; Ilonka had a daughter Margaret; and Juliska had a son. On October 15, 1941, Laszlo Szamek married a woman named Magda. They both survived the Holocaust and eventually had a son, Laszlo Jr.
