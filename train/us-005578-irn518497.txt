Consists of correspondence, documents, realia, manuscripts, and photographs related to the Holocaust experiences of the Spanier family, originally of Berlin, Germany.

The collection includes Rabbi Spanier's memoirs, written from 1920s-1934, correspondence between Germany and the United States from 1939-1942, and documents regarding John Spanier's attempts to obtain employment in the United States. Also includes John Spanier's colors (ribbon and medallion) of the KC Blaetter German-Jewish youth organization.
