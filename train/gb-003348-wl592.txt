The creators of 592/1-3, <i>J端dische Nachrichten</i> (JUNA), was founded by the Schweizerischer Israelitischer Gemeindebund (SIG), Z端rich, as its press office in 1936, with the objectives not only to confront Nazism but also to address growing Anti-semitism in Switzerland. To this end it produced news bulletins in German and French and distributed them to numerous editorial offices throughout Switzerland.</p><p>Under the leadership of Dr. Benjamin Sagalowitz (1938-1964) JUNA amassed a large archive of documentation<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a> concerning the Holocaust and the fate of Jewish refugees and other related subjects.

Parts of this archive were used to create the three dossiers in this collection.</p><p>The three dossiers, all produced in 1955, and apparently emanating from the same source<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a>, have been produced in the same format. Namely, an introductory essay on a topic punctuated by references to related transcript documents (<em>Beilage</em>). The second section of these dossiers consists of the document transcripts themselves arranged in numerical order.</p><p>592/1-3 were produced by JUNA c1955 and are concerned with the following subjects: Papers re Jewish refugees from the files of Armand Brunschvig, former president of <em>J端dische Fl端chtlingshilfe</em>, Geneva (592/1); 'What was known about the fate of the Jews in Switzerland' (592/2); 'Swiss asylum policy with respect to Jewish refugees' (592/3).<br /><br />A deposit made by W.
