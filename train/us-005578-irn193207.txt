Max Landwirth (1863-1943) was born in Kraków, in what was then part of the Austrian Empire, on 21 July 1863. He served in the Austrian army, prior to immigrating to the United States. He initially settled in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where he opened a clothing store. On 21 August 1898, he married Mollie Drebin, of Michigan City, Indiana, but after their wedding, the couple returned to Vicksburg. Due to Mrs. Landwirth’s health, however, they decided to return to Michigan City shortly thereafter, and Landwirth opened a clothing store in that city, which he operated until his retirement in 1929. The Landwirths had six children: Anna, Ella, Morris, Charles, Leonard, and Meyer. Max Landwirth died in Michigan City at the age of 80, in November 1943.

Correspondence, affidavits, tax returns, telegrams, photographs and other documents primarily related to the efforts of Max Landwirth (1863-1943), of Michigan City, Indiana, to assist relatives in Germany and Austria with immigration to the United States, as a result of Nazi persecution in those countries, 1938-1939.
