The Wolf and Gidanskis letters consist of letters written in Yiddish between December 1938 and April 1941 in Lithuanian. One letter was written by Yitzhak Zev Wolf and eleven letters by Josef Gidanskis to his niece, Esther Golde. In the letters, Mr. Gidanskis discusses pre-war Jewish life in Lithuania and alludes to the news he is hearing about the Holocaust.
