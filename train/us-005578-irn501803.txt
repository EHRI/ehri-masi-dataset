Frida Rabenstein was born on 5 September 1927 in Velik√° Kopana (Podkarpatska Rus, Czechoslovakia) to Serena and Solomon Jozsef. She had nine siblings. Her parents owned a flower and oil mill. In April 1944 her family was sent to the ghetto. She was then deported to Auschwitz and housed in Lager C. She was then transferred to the Breslau-Hundsfeld work camp to work in an ammunition factory. As the Soviet Red Army approached in January 1945 Frida was sent on a death march to Gross-Rosen, and then to Bergen-Belsen where she was liberated by British soldiers on 15 April. After the war she went to Sweden and then immigrated to the United States in 1951.
