Sandra Glassman's poems, "A Memory in History" and "A Somber Experience," describe her feelings while thinking about the Holocaust and the USHMM. Glassman's musical composition, "Dollhouse (Josette)," was influenced by reading Jacqueline Wolf's memoir, "Take Care of Josette," which is based upon Wolf's experiences caring for her four-year-old sister in Nazi occupied France after their parents had been deported.
