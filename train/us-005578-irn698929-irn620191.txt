Kaddish For Terezin (Holocaust Requiem)

Kaddish For Terezin is an oratorio performed on November 3, 1988. Ronald Senator, a well-known contemporary British composer, and his collaborator on the lyrics, Rabbi Albert Friedlander of Westminster Synagogue in London and former rabbi of the East Hampton Jewish Center, make the doomed young poets of Terezin the focal point of their commemorative piece. Children, age 7 through 16, appear with the Brooklyn Philharmonic, conducted by Lukas Foss; the Long Island Symphonic Choral Association; the Gregg Smith Singers, and such soloists as the soprano Lucille Sullam and Cantor Jay Hiburn of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.
