Sucher Rubin (later Sol Rubin, 1922-2017) was born on 14 February 1922 in Radom, Poland to Jacob and Chaja (née Wolanowska) Rubin. He had one brother Gedalja. After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Sucher was sent to the Dęblin ghetto. He was sent to a forced-work camp in Dęblin until October 1942 when he was transferred to the Częstochowa ghetto. In July 1944 he was deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp where he was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945. In November 1945 he went to the Foehrenwald displaced persons camp. Lola Rubin (1923-2011) was born Lola Teichman on 5 May 1923 in Dęblin, Poland to Chaim and Sara (née Kiwowitach, b. 1901) Teichman. She had one sister, Szark (later Szark Witl, b. 1921), and two brothers, Berek (b. 1931) and Abraham (b. 1941). After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Lola was sent to the Dęblin ghetto. She was later sent to a forced work camp in Dęblin until October 1942 when she was transferred to the Częstochowa ghetto. In July 1944 she was deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she was liberated by British troops in April 1945. Sucher and Lola married while in Foehrenwald. Their son Jakob (later Jack) was born in the DP camp. Sucher was a master locksmith and provided professional training to other survivors while in the camp. The family immigrated to the United States in 1949 aboard the USS General R. M. Blatchford. They settled in Michigan where their second son Marvin was born.

The collection consists of photographs primarily depicting Sucher and Lola Rubin and their son Jack in the Foehrenwald displaced persons camp between 1945 and 1949. Some photographs may also have been taken at the Landsberg displaced persons camp.
