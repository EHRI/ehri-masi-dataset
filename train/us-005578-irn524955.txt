Ann Goldman (1917-2001, later Ann Pravder) was born in Kłodawa, Poland to Menachem Mendel Goldman (d. 1939) and Sadie Goldman Ehrlich (d. 1963). Ann had two brothers, Moti Leibman and Itzik. Her family, except for her brother Moti, all moved to the United States around 1922. Ann married Sidney Pravder (1909-2002) in the 1930s. She joined Vaad Hatzala in 1942 while attending Barnard College, and was active with the organization during and after the war. Her activities with Vaad Hatzala included serving on their board of directors, lobbying in Washington, D.C., working with Save the Children, and traveling overseas to France and Germany after the war to aid in assisting refugees. Her brother Moti Leibman and his wife and children were killed in the Holocaust.

The Ann Goldman papers document her work with the Vaad Hatzala in the 1940s. The documents contain a dinner program, vaccination certificate, travel documents, refugee data sheets, passenger list for the R.M.S. Queen Mary, and two undated letters. The photographs include photos of Ann’s brother Moti Leibman and his wife; Ann with Vaad Hatzala staff in Frankfurt and Munich, Germany; dinners for Henry Morgenthau and Binyamin Mintz; Vaad Hatzala staff with ambulances to be delivered to Palestine; and Ann Goldman with an unidentified person.
