Phillip Greenglass (born Phillip Greenglas, 1903-1969) was born on 1 January 1903 in Babruĭsk, Belarus (also known as Babruysk and Bobruĭsk). He was one of eight children, and immigrated to the United States by 1923 where he likely lived with his aunt and uncle. During the Holocaust, Phillip’s brother Jacob served in the Russian Army and survived the war. His parents and other siblings all perished in Babruĭsk.

The collection consists of letters written to Phillip Greenglass in the United States from his family in Babruĭsk, Belarus. A select few letters in Russian also include donor-provided translations. Also included are pre-war photographs of Phillip’s family in Babruĭsk and depictions of his visit with his family in Babruĭsk in 1938.
