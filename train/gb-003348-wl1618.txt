In 1938, after the annexation of Austria, the hospital was taken over by the SS. All Jewish personnel were dismissed and patients forcibly discharged. Dr Bieder fled to Switzerland, where he worked in a psychiatric hospital for 15 months. In 1939 his application for an entry permit into New Zealand was accepted and he sailed for Wellington during the week that war was declared. See 1618/9 for a more detailed biography.

This collection documents the lives of members of an Austrian Jewish family whose destinies were forever changed by the rise of Nazism. The papers date from immediately after the Anschluss until the 1950s, by which time the surviving members had settled in their newly adopted countries. The largest group of letters date from 1938-1939, after Ludwig Bieder left Austria for Switzerland and before he departed for New Zealand. The principal subjects are his desperate attempts to extricate his parents from Vienna to a safe haven; his efforts to obtain a visa for himself; and his love affair with Alice Lafitteau, widow of the Swedish ambassador to Vienna.</p><p>In addition there is correspondence from a friend, Otto Gmeiner, who was instrumental in the survival of Ludwig Bieder's parents in Belgium during the war.
