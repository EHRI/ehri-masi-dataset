Bernard (now Bernhard) Storch was born in Bochnia, Poland, in 1922. When the Nazis invaded Poland in September 1939, Mr. Storch was put into forced labor near Lwów, Poland, until May 1940, when he fled to Siberia. There, he met and married Ruth Krause, who was originally from Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Poland and had also fled to Siberia. In November 1942, Mr. Storch enlisted in the First Polish Infantry Division and served with this division until October 1945, participating in the liberations of the Majdanek, Sobibor, Chelmno, and Sachsenhausen concentration camps. In 1946, reunited with Ruth, they lived in the Bad Reichenhall displaced persons camp until immigrating to the United States in April 1947.

Consists of pre-war, wartime, and post-war family photographs from Bernhard Storch. Includes photographs of the Krause family of Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Poland, many of whom perished in Treblinka.
