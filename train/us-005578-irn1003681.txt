Freikorps troops in Munich after the Spartacist uprising.

Government, Freikorps, and Stahlhelm troops march along the streets of Munich after crushing the Spartacist uprising. Crowds of people line the street to watch. An armored car drives down the street; soldiers unload muntitions from horse-drawn wagons; a long line of soldiers and wagons march through an archway. The next scenes show various buildings, riddled with bullet holes and otherwise damaged by fighting.
