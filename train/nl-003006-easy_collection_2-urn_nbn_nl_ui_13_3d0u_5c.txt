Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 04 Marco (Marcus) de Groot Project 'Late gevolgen van Sobibor'

Marco de Groot was born in 1939 in Amsterdam and grew up there. He still has recollections of his parents, who were rounded up. His heavily pregnant mother was betrayed and taken away from the hiding place where she and her son Marco were staying at the time; at that very moment little Marco was playing at the neighbours. Marco's father, who was also in hiding, tried to find another hiding place in Amsterdam for him. From August 1944 onwards Marco lived in Rustenburgerstraat with people who cared for him but were in a bad marriage themselves. He stayed with them after the war. When his foster parents divorced, Marco followed his father, who had a new wife and family. He did not feel at home here and left his parents as soon as he could. Despite his mental health problems, caused by his past experiences, Marco managed to build a new life. He made a career with "Hollandse Lloyd", founded two businesses, and married Riet. Together they have a daughter and a son. Both Marco's father and his mother were killed in Sobibor.
