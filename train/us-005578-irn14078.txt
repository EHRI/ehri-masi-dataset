The Gertrude Heller Fischbach collection consists of six photographs relating to the family of Gertrude Fischbach (née Heller). Pictured in the photographs are the parents of Gertrude Fischbach Moritz Heller (b. December 30, 1876) and Friede Heller (b. May 25, 1880), and her parents-in-law Jonas Fischbach (b. October 17, 1885) and Amalie Fischbach (née Dull, b. September 29, 1884). The photographs were taken in Klagenfurt, Austria in 1938; London, England, circa 1939; and 1943-1944 after their arrival in the United States. All pictured were passengers on the MS St. Louis and eventually immigrated to the United States. Moritz and Friede Heller disembarked the MS St. Louis in England and Jonas and Amalie Fischbach disembarked the ship in France.
