Following Second World War trials with Nazi criminals and their collaborators were organized on the territory of restored Czechoslovakia just like in many other European countries of those days. Three-tier retributive justice system was established in the Slovak part of post-war Czechoslovakia by the Regulation of the Slovak National Council no. 33/1945 on the Punishment of Fascist Criminals, Occupants, Traitors and Collaborators and on the Establishment of People’s Judiciary. National Court in Bratislava, District People’s Courts (Okresný ľudový súd) and Local People´s Courts represented the system of the retributive judiciary in Slovakia in 1945 - 1947. These courts ceased to function by 31 December 1947. Unfinished cases were subsequently transferred to jurisdiction of special senates of County courts. However after the Communist coup in 1948 a new law was adopted on 25 March 1948 which renewed the decree on retributive justice in whole Czechoslovak republic and new People´s Courts were established.
