These include, in particular, the complaints of Jews: the alienation of houses, robbery of property, etc. The cases cover the circumstances in which the damage occurred. The group of civil cases testifies about fining of Jews who did not leave their homes in time and did not move to areas determined by the occupation authorities, or did not contribute their share into the indemnity imposed by the authorities. There is a group of civil cases about property: claims regarding the unlawful seizure and distribution of Jewish dwellings, furniture, and other property. These cases are marked by dates immediately after the publication of administrative documents on the resettlement of Jews into ghetto (December 5, 1941) and, especially, after the massive massacre of the Jewish population (September 19, 1941; April 16, 1942). Around these dates also there are files relating to deaths of some Jews, those found hanged, drowned or poisoned. In all such cases, there were decisions to close them specifying the reason for that, namely suicide of figurant. Documents are dated mostly 1941-1942.
