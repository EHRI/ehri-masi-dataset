Recycling of Polish books into Nazi-approved books; anti-Semitic propaganda

A woman's hands are shown tearing apart books and placing the pages in a basket. Most of the titles are in Polish, but one is "Bismarck" by Emil Ludwig. In an obviously staged scene, three Jews are shown shaking their heads, presumably in dismay at the destruction of the books. One of them wears an armband. More shots of the hands tearing pages, then the interior of a paper recycling facility, with huge piles of book pages. Workers throw the pages into a large receptacle, where they are ground into a powder by large stone wheels. The rest of the recycling process is shown. The end products are newspapers (Kurier Warszawski) and a German-Polish dictionary.
