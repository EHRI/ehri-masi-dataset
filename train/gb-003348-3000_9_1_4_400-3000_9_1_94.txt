Correspondence with Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR)

Founded in 1941 by refugees from central Europe the Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) provides social, welfare and care services to Jewish Nazi victims and their descendants living in Great Britain. Additionally, AJR supports educational, research and commemorative projects. See Association of Jewish Refugees (ed.), , London, Association of Jewish Refugees, 2001.

The correspondence - with AJR chairman Werner Rosenstock almost exclusively - comprises a wide variety of issues including amongst others: an AJR Information editorial on the work of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organisation; an obituary on Ludwig Foerder; publishing the memoirs of Gustav Schr√∂der, captain of the MS St. Louis, in England; the visit of The Wiener Library by a group of young German unionists; and an appreciation of Leonard Montefiore in the AJR Information on occasion of his 70th birthday.
