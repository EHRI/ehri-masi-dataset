Reichsbank note, valued at 5 Reichsmark, distributed in Germany from August 1942 to 1948. The Reichsmark became the national currency of Germany in 1924, replacing the Rentenmark, which had been issued as temporary currency in 1923. The Rentenmark was created to address the economic hyperinflation that had been brought on by Germany’s actions following World War I, and smooth the transition from the worthless Papiermark to the Reichsmark. Originally, the Reichsmark was backed by the gold standard, but was taken off that and stood alone following the 1929 market crash. It was initially issued in values of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 1000, but in 1942, the 5 Reichsmark note was introduced. It was designed to replace the silver, 5 Reichsmark coins that people were hoarding for the perceived value of the silver. The note includes multiple examples of imagery and symbolism valued by the Nazi party. The front features a young, German man with the idealized Aryan features, and the Reichsbank seal with the Reichsadler gripping a swastika in the center. The back includes an image of the Brunswick Cathedral and Brunswick Lion statue, symbols of Germany’s long history. The image is flanked by depictions of an agrarian woman representing farming and a male laborer representing industry, two aspects of society that the Nazi party viewed as the basis for economic prosperity. The Reichsmark was officially replaced by the Deutsche Mark in 1945, when Germany was placed under allied occupation, but it remained legal tender until 1948.
