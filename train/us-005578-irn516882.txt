Abraham (Abe) Morgenstern was born in 1923 in Lublin, Poland. His parents were Russian Jews who moved to Lublin in 1921. Abe attended both a Polish public school and a Jewish school. He graduated from a business school at the age of 16 in 1939. In April 1942, the Morgenstern family was forced to move into one of Lublin’s two ghettos. Abe’s father and sister perished during one of the first actions. Abe and his mother survived and were eventually liberated by the Russians. After the war, they immigrated to Italy, and later to the United States.

The collection consists of two photographs from a DP camp in Bari, Italy, after World War II and one photograph of the graduating class from a business school in Chortkov, Poland (now Chortkiv, Ukraine), in 1939.
