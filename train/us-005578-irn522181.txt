Lore Baer was born on 26 Aug. 1938 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. She was the daughter of Ernst Leo Baer (b. 14 Apr. 1907 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and Edith Baer. Lore and her parents survived the Holocaust by hiding in the Netherlands. At age 5, Loreâ€™s parents hid her on a farm with a family including their daughter, Cornelia Schouten. Lore was reunited with her parents after the war.

The collection consists of three copy photographs of the Schouten farm, 175 Oosterblokker, Netherlands, and the Baer family. The original photographs were taken after the end of World War II in 1945.
