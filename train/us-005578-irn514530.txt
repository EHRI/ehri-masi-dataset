Marianne Willems-Hendrix was born on Jan. 28, 1939, in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Paul Hendrix, a stockbroker, and Berthe Vles Hendrix, a housewife. After the German invasion of the Netherlands, Paul Hendrix served on the finance committee of the Amsterdam Jewish Council. On September 23, 1943, the Hendrix family was sent to Westerbork transit camp. Realizing that Marianne was too young to survive at the camp, Paul Hendrix declared that his daughter was an illegitimate child, and in February 1944 she was sent to live with her mother's sister and her non-Jewish husband. During the summer of 1944 the Hendrix family was deported to Theresienstadt and then to Auschwitz. Marianne's mother and brother, Hans Leonard, perished on October 25, 1944. Her father perished in Golleschau, a sub-camp of Auschwitz, on December 14, 1944, and her brother, Robert, died in Mauthausen shortly before liberation on March 30, 1945. After World War II Marianne continued to live with her aunt and uncle.

The collection consists of three scrapbooks. One scrapbook contains photographs, correspondence, and other documents relating to Paul and Berthe Hendrixâ€™s courtship, wedding, and honeymoon. The other two scrapbooks are baby books for Paul and Berte Hendrix's sons; one for Robert Alexander Hendrix (b. May 12, 1930) and the other for Hans Leonard Hendrix (b. January 31, 1933).
