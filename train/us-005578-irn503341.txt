United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

The collection consists of a letter written by Cecilie Klein to her mother regarding her thoughts about the deaths of family members during the Holocaust and sixteen photographs mostly of the donor's family taken before, during, or directly after the Holocaust. All of the photographs were taken in Czechoslovakia or Auschwitz except an image of a memorial which was given to Cecilie Klein-Pollack by a woman from Russia.
