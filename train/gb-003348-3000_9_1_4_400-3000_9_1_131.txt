Dr. George Francis Jack Bergman (born Georg Franz Bergmann; 1900-1979) was a Jewish-German solicitor. The World War I veteran and subsequent member had emigrated to France in 1933. With the beginning of the Second World War he served in the Foreign Legion and was incarcerated in several French internment camps in Algeria by the Vichy Regime at some point. Liberated by the Allies, he joined the British Army in 1943. Later Bergman immigrated to Australia, where he conducted research on Jewish history. See Röder, W. and H. Strauss (ed.), , Munich, Saur, 1980, p. 55.
