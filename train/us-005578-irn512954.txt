Joseph Szlifersztejn (later Joseph Stein) was the tenth child of Moshe and Rachel Szlifersztejn and was born in Warsaw, Poland circa 1906. Joseph, his wife Tola, and his young daughter immigrated to New York. The remainder of the family was imprisoned in the Warsaw ghetto and never escaped. Of Joseph's family in Warsaw, only his nephew Lutek (or Lawrence), son of Joseph's brother David, survived, fleeing to Kiev and later to Luck. In 1941, Lawrence moved east once again to escape the Nazi advance. Captured and consigned to the Sverdlovsk labor camp and then into the Red Army, Lutek contacted his uncle, Joseph Stein, in New York in 1941. After liberation, Joseph Stein helped Lutek immigrate to Sweden, Cuba, and eventually in 1951, to the United States. The exact fate of the Warsaw Szlifersztejns and Mitelsbachs is unknown. All are presumed to have perished during the Holocaust.

Contains documents pertaining to the Szlifersztejn and Mitelsbach families, living in the Warsaw ghetto from 1939-1941. Primarily contains correspondence written to Joseph and Tola Stein in New York.
