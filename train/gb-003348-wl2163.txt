The writer, dramatist and painter Ernst Martin Benedikt (1882-1973) was the son of the journalist and editor Moriz Benedikt, who ran the Viennese newspaper <em>Neue Freie Presse</em>. Ernst studied law and wrote for his father’s paper; after Moriz’s death, he became its owner and, until 1935, chief editor. He was imprisoned after the November Pogrom until April 1939. The next month he left Austria for the UK, travelling on to Sweden in July. Here he wrote for various Swedish publications. He returned to Austria in 1962 and died on 28 December 1973.
