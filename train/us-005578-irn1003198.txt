Hitler and Hindenburg reviewing troops

Title: "Hindenburg-Hitler coalition grips all Germany - Leaders honor war dead on the eve of creation of Nazi dictatorship." Hitler, von Hindenburg, and von Papen are shown standing in a balcony of the Berlin opera house, on the annual occasion honoring German war dead. The narrator notes that Hindenburg has thrown his full support behind Hitler. A frail looking Hindenburg leaves the opera house and reviews troops as the narrator notes that Hitler has just asked the Reichstag for full dictatorial powers. The narrator states that Hindenburg is now 85 years old and wonders, "When his time comes, what will happen to Germany?" He notes that the question is of great interest to the rest of the world. Clip ends with soldiers marching; Nazi flags in the foreground.
