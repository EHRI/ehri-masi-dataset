Ohly, the depositor, came to Great Britain in 1945 to join his father, who had returned to Great Britain in 1934. Since he was half Jewish he could no longer work in his profession as a sculptor in Germany. As he was born here it was not a problem. E. Ohly left Germany in 1934 for school in Switzerland and lived there until 1945. His mother, Gertrud, being half Jewish, survived the war and died in Munich on 20 March 1951.

This collection of papers documents in part the experiences of a German Jewish family from Munich. The papers include original correspondence from friends and relatives and material from the Jewish organizations which arranged the details of the transport to Terezin.
