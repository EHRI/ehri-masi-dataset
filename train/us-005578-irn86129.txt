Josef Hirschhorn was born on February 5, 1926 in Oradea, Romania, to Martin and Irene (née Seidmann) Hirschhorn. In 1944, a few years after Oradea had been re-incorporated into Hungary and re-named Nagyvárad, he was deported from Nagyvárad to Sachsenhausen, where he was assigned prisoner number 80777. He is presumed to have died in Sachsenhausen.

Consists of a copyprint of a portrait of Josef Hirschhorn, originally of Oradea, Romania. Also includes a letter written by Hirschhorn on Sachsenhausen camp stationery, dated 13 August 1944, prior to his death, presumably at Sachsenhausen. It was the last letter the family received from Hirschhorn.
