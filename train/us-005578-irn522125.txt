Consists of documents and correspondence relating to the pre-war, wartime, and post-war experiences of Emil and Martha Feigenbaum, originally of Berlin, Germany. The papers specifically concern emigration, employment, and visa issues. Although the couple was able to emigrate to the United States before the war, despite attempts, they were unable to save Emil's parents, Meier and Flora, both of whom perished in the Holocaust.
