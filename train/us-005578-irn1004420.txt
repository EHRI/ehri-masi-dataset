Denmark general election

A report about the March 23, 1943 general election in Denmark. Men on bicycles exit a building (holding bags of ballots?). Montage of Danish pamphlets and newspapers about the election. A sign announces that it is election day. Flags in the streets of Copenhagen. A crowd of people outside a polling place (?). A woman affixes a badge with a Danish flag, presumably an indication that he has voted, to a man's lapel. A horse-drawn taxi drives down the street. Citizens enter a polling place. Overhead shot of people in voting booths. Boxes of ballots are emptied and sorted at tables.
