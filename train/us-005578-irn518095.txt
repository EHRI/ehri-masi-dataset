Hugo Heilbronn (1900-1964) was born in Geisig, Germany to Louis and Rosa Heilbronn. Else Wertheim Heilbronn (1911-1998) was born in Brünen, Germany to Levy and Selma Wertheim. Hugo immigrated to the United States in 1938, and Else and their daughter Ruth (b. 1935 in Lahnstein) followed in 1939. Hugo’s parents Louis (b. 1869) and Rosa Heilbronn (b. 1873), sister and nieces Hannah (b. 1905), Irmgard (b. 1931), Elsbeth (b. 1933), and Helga Tobias (b. 1938), and aunt Emmy Rosenthal (b. 1884) were deported to Łódź in October 1941 and were later killed at Auschwitz. Hannah’s husband Louis Tobias (b. 1907) survived Łódź and Auschwitz and immigrated to the United States in 1946. Emil (b. 1874) and Kathinka Heilbron (b. 1883) and Lina Rosenthal (b. 1898) were deported from Frankfurt to Kowno and killed there in November 1941.

In December 1941, Else Wertheim Heilbronn's mother and brothers Selma (b. 1877), Walter (b. 1904), and Pau Wertheiml (b. 1915) were deported from Düsseldorf to Riga, where they are presumed to have been killed. Her sister Henny (b. 1905) and brother-in-law Simon Strauss (b. 1901) were deported to the Gurs concentration camp in France in October 1940, transferred to Les Milles and Marseilles in late 1941, and transferred via Drancy to Auschwitz in August 1942, where they were killed.
