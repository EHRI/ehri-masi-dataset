Murray Pantirer was born on June 15, 1925, in Krakow, Poland. After the Germans occupied Krakow in 1939, Murray’s family separated several times in search of food and other necessities and was finally confined to the Kraków ghetto. In 1942, Murray and one of his brothers were deported for forced labor in Płaszów, Poland. In May 1944, his brother was sent to Auschwitz. That year, Murray was transferred to Gross-Rosen and to Brünnlitz concentration camps to work for the German industrialist Oskar Schindler. Murray was liberated on May 10, 1945, the only one of nine family members to survive. After liberation, Murray returned to Poland, but felt the presence of antisemitism and decided not to stay. He went to a displaced persons camp in Linz, Austria, where he met and married his wife. Through the American consul in Salzburg, Austria, they arranged to immigrate to the United States and arrived in the U.S. on the S.S. Marine Fletcher in January 1949.

The papers consist of sworn statements of identity ("Protokoll"), photographs of the Pantirer family, and a booklet published immediately after the liberation of Dachau with captioned photographs taken at the time of liberation.
