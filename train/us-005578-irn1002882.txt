Kiev during first days of war

First weeks of war in Kiev. Wartime in countryside, building defense lines. Stalin, Krushchev, and other Soviet officials and politicians are seen clapping, supposedly celebrating the unification of Ukraine. Cut to the countryside (probably just outside of Kiev), where people dressed in traditional Ukrainian folk costumes celebrate, marching on the streets. They appear to enter Kiev, though this may be a different group entirely. The marchers carry banners, including a picture of Stalin. Khruschev waves at the crowd. Girls appear to wave back. Others hold up flowers and five-point stars. Factories. More shots of Kiev during the first days of the war, building street defenses, famous song is heard on soundtrack, "Secret Ra." Translation of Russian narration: On November 1, 1939, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR complied with the request of Western Ukrainian workers and included Western Ukraine in the USSR; it has reunited with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialistic Republic. Throughout Ukraine, Stalin - the dearest friend of the Ukrainian people - is glorified. Under the sun of the Stalinist constitution, our country has blossomed [coincides with overhead shot of huge crowds marching through the streets of Kiev]. Ukraine has become a republic of industrial might and agricultural strength [coincides with factory shots].
