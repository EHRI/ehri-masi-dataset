Animated map from Brest to Antwerp. Members of the Milice leave a prison building and stand at attention. CU on a patch on the uniform of one man. The Milice leads a column of resistance fighters out of the prison under armed guard. CU of the shattered windshield of a car that has been attacked by "terrorists." German field police check papers of vehicles and pedestrians, including an elderly man with glasses and a beard. The Germans interrogate the owner of a farm and then burn his farm. The Germans find and inspect false French currency printed by the Americans. German troops march down a road and turn back to smile at the camera.
