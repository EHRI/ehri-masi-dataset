These papers document, in part, the activities of a number of Jewish and anti-racist organisations in Argentina during the 1930s. The following organisations are represented:<p>Delegacíon de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas- Originally called the Comite contra el Racismo y el Antisemitismo de la Argentina, this umbrella organisation was founded in July 1935 for all important Jewish bodies in Argentina apart from the communists.</p><p>Hilfsverein Deutschsprechender Juden- founded by seven members of the German Jewish immigrant community of Buenos Aires who had been ostracized by Buenos Aires' non-Jewish ‘German Colony'. The organisation assisted German Jewish immigrants who could no longer rely on the support of the German non-Jewish institutions many of which had succumbed to Nazi antisemitic propaganda.</p><p>Comite contra el Racismo y el Antisemitismo de la Argentina- founded by Argentine Jews in December 1934 comprising delegates from the major Jewish organisations and supported by the Jewish Colonization Association.</p><p>Organizacion popular contra el Antisemitismo</p><p>For further information on the background to these organisations and on the subjects of German Jewish immigration and antisemitism in pre-war Argentina see <em>Argentina and the Jews: a History of German Jewish Immigration</em>, by Haim Avni, translated by Gila Brand, University of Alabama Press, 1991.</p>
