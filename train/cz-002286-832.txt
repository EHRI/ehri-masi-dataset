The Ministry of Justice was established in 1918 after the constitution of the first Czechoslovak republic. Its scope of authority was to control to organise and to administer all matters of public courts and prosecutor offices, prison services, pedagogical institutions for the young or matters of Czechoslovak layers and notaries and other formal orders, regulations and laws.

In the fonds, there are documents and records from the legislative council, public prosecutors and judicial administration department. There are also files containing reports from the criminal department and the prison department.

The jewish related documents are in several boxes concerning more the matter of antisemitism in the Czechoslovak republic in the thirties than the matter of holocaust. In the boxes there can be found complaints on Jewish notaries and layers and also their requests for granting permission to work in law practice. There are also lists (dated between years 1919-1945) of those jewish layers who were excluded from the work in law practice 

In box number 245, there are official regulations against the Jewish notaries and layers from 1943.
