Documents, corrrespondence, and photographs illustrating the experiences of Benjamin and Sara Kurz, and their daughter Diana who fled Nazi occupied Austria in 1938 and immigrated to the United Kingdom and eventually, to the United States. Because Benjamin was born in Plotycze, Poland, he had a Polish quota number for immigration to the United States, and was able to flee.
