Edward Stern (Erhard Stern) was born in 1918 at the house of his parents, Heinrich and Erna, in Berlin, which also served as his father’s law practice. His father, Heinrich Stern (1882-1950), a lawyer and notary, was born in Berlin and died in London. His mother, Erna Stern née Rochmann (1891-1961), also born in Berlin and died in London. Edward attended school in Berlin up until the age of 16 and shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, then he was sent to Switzerland for 5 months thence to Paris, where his parents had decided to move the family. His father, who could no longer work as a lawyer, tried unsuccessfully to establish an import export business. The family moved to London where Edward began to attend school. The parents returned to Germany when the last of their savings ran out whilst Edward continued at school. The parents managed to return to the UK before the outbreak of war. Edward commenced his studies in dentistry. During the war he joined up with the Pioneer Corps and was stationed in various places. In 1944 he qualified as a dentist and began working at a clinic in Tottenham. He eventually started his own practice. Like his parents, Edward considered himself a fully assimilated Jew.

This collect comprises mostly the personal papers of Edward Stern with reference to his school record, his employment history and his army record; also included are papers pertaining to his wife, Ellen and his father and mother, Heinrich and Erna.
