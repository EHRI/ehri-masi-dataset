Redistribution of land in Latvia

Redistribution of land in Latvia. A large group of Latvian civilians, many of them elderly, stand in a square decorated with swastika flags. Some of them hold signs with the German and the Latvian place names of their settlements. A German official hands out documents to the Latvians and shakes their hands. The next scene shows the same official going up to a house and greeting an old woman, and old man, and a younger man at the door. The official hands over a document, which the younger man reads to the older couple. In a different location in Latvia, pan down a church tower, then shots of Latvians leaving church. Pan around the town square with crowds of people outside. 01:23:24 Italian naval team plays football against Bersaglieri. Team members give fascist salute. (Not ordered by USHMM)
