Contains 11 black and white photographs taken by George Pratt Wooters (donor's husband), US Army Private First Class, who was stationed in Germany during WWII. The photos document exhumed corpses from a mass grave near Nammering, Germany that was discovered by US troops on April 28, 1945; American officers in the area forced imprisoned SS POWs housed nearby to exhume corpses and lay them out on either side of the ravine above the mass grave.
