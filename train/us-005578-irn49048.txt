1

Consists of one memoir, 334 pages, entitled "The Last Train to Auschwitz," by Gary Younger, regarding the Holocaust experiences of his father, Benzion Junger (now Ben Younger) originally of Sapinka in Transylvania (which later became Hungarian). He describes pre-war antisemitism, deportation to the Sapinka ghetto in the spring of 1944, and life in the ghetto. They were deported to Auschwitz in May 1944, where Benzion was separated from his parents and younger sister Reizl, who perished. He saw his sister, Perl, in Auschwitz, but she did not survive the war. He and his uncle, David, were sent from Auschwitz to clean the empty Warsaw ghetto. As the Russians approached Warsaw, they were sent to Dachau for a week before being transferred to Kaufering, where David perished. He escaped from a transport train and had several narrow escapes before being liberated by the American army and sent to a sanatorium in Sankt Ottilien to recover. He spent time in the Feldafing and Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camps and reunited with two cousins who survived. He and a friend were able to immigrate to Canada in 1948. Benzion's testimony (which is transcribed from audiotapes) is interspersed with his son Gary's travelog of the trip he took with his father to retrace Benzion's life in Europe.
