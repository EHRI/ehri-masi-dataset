Morris Kornberg was born in Przebr̤z, Poland on Jan. 6, 1918. He was the youngest of seven children in a strictly Orthodox family. When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, he was forced to work. He lived in a ghetto and worked in a factory. Morris was imprisoned in Klonskie, a prison in Poland, taken to Radom, Poland, and then to Jawischowitz, a subcamp of Auschwitz in Poland. He worked in a coal mine and received special treatment by the SS for his memory for numbers. He was evacuated to Tröglitz, a subcamp of Buchenwald in Germany, in Jan.1945. Tröglitz was evacuated on Apr. 9, 1945. Morris was put on a train and escaped with two others. They were caught and forced on a death march to Leitmeritz, a subcamp of Flossenbürg in Germany, then to Theresienstadt (Terezi̕n), a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia, where he was liberated. He went to a sanitarium outside of Stuttgart, Germany. He met his wife in Stuttgart and immigrated to the United States in 1949.

The collection consists of photographs of Morris Kornberg and his friends; an identification card for the Jewish Community of Wuerttemberg (Israelitische Kultusvereinigung Württemberg); and a commemorative album with tipped-in photographs by Alexander Fiedel of the "Jidiszer D.P. Center UNRRA - P.C. IRO in Stuttgart" written by M. Kornberg.
