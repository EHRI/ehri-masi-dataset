Aaron Finger (1918-2013) was born on either 7 or 8 August 1918 in Toronto, Canada to Simon and Celia Finger. Simon (b. 1884) and Celia (née Feigenbaum, d. 1966) immigrated to the United States from Galicia, and married in New York City on 12 December 1908. Unable to find work in New York, the family moved to Toronto. Simon worked as a tailor and Celia made wigs for Orthodox Jewish women. Yiddish was often spoke at home. The family later moved back to New York in 1920. Aaron had two older siblings: Zelda and Harry, and one younger brother, Seymour (b. 1923). Aaron enlisted with the United States Army in May 1943. He trained at Camp Ritchie in Maryland, becoming one of the Ritchie Boys trained in intelligence, language, and interrogation. He went overseas in post-war in fall 1945, and spent time in Germany, including the Flossenbürg concentration camp and Hof, where he worked with his Russian counterpart on prisoner exchanges among other tasks. He was discharged in July 1946 as a Second Lieutenant in the 405th Infantry, 102nd Division. His brother Harry also served in the army. After Aaron returned to the United States, he married Henrietta Treister on 8 February 1948. The family settled in Queens, New York where he became a junior high school teacher.

Henrietta Treister (later Henrietta Finger, 1925-2007) was born in 1925 to Adolf and Rae Treister. Her father Adolf (born Chaim Treister, b. 1892) was born in Bolechów, Galicia (Bolekhiv, Ukraine) to Zvi Hirsch Treister and Chanas Horschowski. His father was a horse trader, and Adolf apprenticed as a barber before immigrating to the United States with his sister Sadie in 1908. He moved to Uitica to work as a barber and married Rae Pizer there in 1920. Rae (Rachel, b. 1892) was born in Utica to Rueben Pizer and Mollie Fath Pizer. Both of her parents were born in Russia. While in Utica, he changed his name from Chaim to Adolf after an accident left his foot seriously injured. Fearing amputation, he changed his name to avoid detection by the doctors. Henrietta had one sister, Ruth (b. 1921). She married Aaron Finger in 1948. At least 11 members of the Treister family in Europe perished during the Holocaust.
