George Rothman was born Georges Bardenstein on 1 September 1933 in Strasbourg, France to Emmanuel (1904-1942) and Esfira (n√©e Chor, 1909-1942) Bardenstein. His family was in Paris during the German occupation. His parents hid George with Philip and Martha Lequien, a Parisian couple whom Esfira used to clean for. George survived the Holocaust hidden with the Lequiens under the false name of George Bardin. His parents were deported from Paris to Drancy on 9 August 1942 and then sent Auschwitz on 21 August 1942 where they both perished. After the war George immigrated to the United States with assistance from his Great Uncle Joseph Rothman.
