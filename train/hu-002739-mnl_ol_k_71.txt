A moot question in the study of the Holocaust in Hungary is how the Hungarian state related to its Jewish citizens who resided in other European countries either occupied by or allied to the Nazis during the implementation of the Holocaust starting in 1941-1942 but before the mass deportations from Hungary in 1944. Two central questions concern how far the Hungarian state aimed to protect them and how it related to their property. The records of the Foreign Ministry’s Department for Attending Hungarian Citizens Abroad contain documents regarding the tackling of social and cultural issues of émigré Hungarians and issues of international social policy. These documents concern the years 1929 to 1944 and are therefore of relevance to the study of the Hungarian state’s policy towards its Jewish citizens during the time of the Holocaust.
