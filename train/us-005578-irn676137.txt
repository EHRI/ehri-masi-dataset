Albert Schwager (1885-1963) was born in August 20, 1885 in Kötzting, Germany to Isidor Isaak Schwager (1860-1927) and Anna Schwager (née Steindler, 1858-1888). Albert’s siblings are Leopold Schwager (1884-1941), Fritz Schwager (1887-1976), and Anna Schwager (1888-1888). Before the war, Albert Schwager worked as a businessman. He married Theresia Schwarz (Resi, 1890-1979). She was born on May 10, 1890 in Roding, Germany to Friedrich and Katherina Schwarz. Albert and Resi Schwager had three children: Fred Schwager (1920-1993), Erich Schwager (1924-1940), and Hildegard Schwager (1927-1942). On November 12, 1938, Albert Schwager was deported to Dachau concentration camp in Germany. At some point, Albert was released from Dachau, likely under the condition that he leave Germany. On May 13, 1939, Albert and Resi Schwager sailed from Hamburg, Germany aboard the MS St. Louis. After the MS St. Louis was refused entry to Cuba, Albert and Resi Schwager eventually disembarked in England, where Josef Schwager served as their guarantor. On February 8, 1940, Albert and Resi Schwager’s son Erich, who suffered from muscular dystrophy, was murdered by the Nazis. By 1942, Albert and Resi Schwager had immigrated to the United States. Albert Schwager died in New York on July 20, 1963 and Resi Schwager died in Pennsylvania on February 27, 1979.
