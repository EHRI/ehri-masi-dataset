The collection includes family photographs of the Stein family in Turaszowka, Poland, dated 1934, taken on the occasion of the visit of Joan Stein (now Joan Diamond) and her parents from the United States and a postcard sent to Ben Stein from his family in Poland telling him that the situation there is not well, dated May 26, 1940, in German. Also included are two travel journals kept by Olga Stein, Benâ€™s wife, during their visits from Passaic, NJ back to Europe to visit family in Poland and Czechslovakia. The journals primarily detail their travel, family, and relatives who were drafted into the US Army during WWII. The first entry from July 1934 mentions seeing Storm Troopers at the train station in Berlin and books condemning the Jews.
