Just after the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (10th of April 1941) temporary offices were formed and operated from April to July 1941. One of these offices that operated in Sarajevo was the Office for Stores (shops) which had a goal to complete seizing of Jewish and Serbian stores and shops. After 2 months, the Office became part of the Ministry of economy, which took over its records and duties.
