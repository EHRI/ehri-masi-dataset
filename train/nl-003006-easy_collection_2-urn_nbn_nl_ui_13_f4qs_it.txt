Sobibor Interviews 1983-1984, interview 08, Hella Weiss

Interview with Hella Weiss (n√©e Felenbaum; Lublin 25 November 1924). Weiss arrived in Sobibor just before Christmas in a horse-drawn cart. She worked in the laundry, had to knit socks and gloves and she tended to the flower garden. About her time in the camp she remembers: "They tormented us terribly". After her escape she fought with the partisans and in the Soviet army. She received six decorations, including the 'Red Star'. An injury landed her in a field hospital. After the war she married a Czech man with whom she ran a wayside restaurant in Israel. Hella Weiss died in December 1988 in Gedera.
