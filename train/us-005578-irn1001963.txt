Idealized picture of Prussia to garner German support for total war

Reel 1 The opening title indicates that the film was written and begun in 1942 and that it is based on historical events. The first scene takes place in Breslau in 1813. General Wilhelm von Gniesenau bursts into the chambers of King Friedrich Wilhelm III and chastises him for refusing to enlist the citizenry to aid in the war effort against Napoleon. Gniesenau reminds the King of the perfomance of the citizens and especially the Mayor of Kolberg. The film flashes back to Vienna in 1806, where Franz II renounces his throne under the peace imposed by Napoleon. Veit Harlan, the director of Kolberg, was allowed to use the actual crown, orb, and scepter of the Holy Roman Empire in this scene. The scene changes again, this time to Kolberg, where the citizens are enjoying a festival with music and dancing.
