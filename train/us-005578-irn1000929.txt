Fundraising newsreel for postwar rehabilitation in the Netherlands

Volkshertsel Amsterdam, 1945. Dutch newsreel containing retrospective footage from throughout WWII, aimed at inciting the Dutch public to give money to support government postwar rehabilitation programs. Narration of the misery of war, accompanied by scenes of people pushing their belongings in the street, soldiers scrambling, burned out buildings, and blindfolded corpses. A train arriving, followed by men walking out of the station under a Dutch flag, changes the tone to the present, and scenes outline various government programs ("Joodische Ontvangst Commissie"-- "Jewish Reception Committee"; "Geneesk Dienst"-- "Medical Services"). Men are shown eating cookies and drinking hot drinks. Citizens receive new clothes and furniture, and children with tags around their necks load onto a truck with their belongings. Scenes of children being cared for inside a hospital and relaxing in its gardens. The screen reads, "Offeren zonder bevel voor Nederlands Volksherstel"-- "Give without injunction for the recovery of the Dutch people."The film closes with two young women shaking donation cans, which read "Volksherstel Amsterdam"-- "recovery for the people of Amsterdam."
