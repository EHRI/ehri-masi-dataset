Kazys Škirpa

One subfonds and 1 file.

The fond consists of the collection of personal documents (see also UHSMM collection description). The most important document in this fonds is the anti-Jewish proclamation of the Front of Lithuanian Activists (LAF; col. Kazys Škirpa was a leader of this Front). The LAF organized the June Uprising (June 23-26, 1941) with the aim of re-establishing Lithuanian independence with the help of Nazis. The members of this Uprising were fighting against communists and Jews and participated in pogroms throughout Lithuania.
