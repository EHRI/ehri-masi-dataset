Visit to Ukraine by Soviet writer Marietta Shaginyan and folk dancing

Marietta Shaginyan (1888-1982): Soviet writer and Lenin Prize winner, was an artist with broad philosophical and social views. Her collections of verse, plays, adventure stories ("Mess-Mend" 1923-1925), and a novel ("Hydroelectric Plant", 1931) were written after Shaginyan had lived quite some time at the construction site of the Dzor Power Station in Armenia. She also wrote the "Ulyanov Family tetralogy" (1937-1968) about V.I. Lenin, various articles, literary portraits, and memoirs ("The Man and the Times", 1980).

"Soviet Ukraine"- Release 43. Soviet writer, Marietta Shaginyan, biographer of Lenin, visits the Ukraine. Speech to Dykan'ka kolkhoz youth in the Poltava region of Ukraine (members of a collective farm group) in Russian (not certain of language of speech as this story is accompanied by voiceover naration in Ukrainian, and the original sound of the speech is not heard, and was perhaps never recorded). Four Ukrainian couples performing Jewish folk dance, they are members of the official Ukrainian State Folk Dance Troupe. Part of this story takes place in the small Ukrainian village of Dykan'ka. Translation of Ukrainian narration: The narration has been somehow shifted - the narration that goes with the dance actually corresponds to the previous piece about the writer. First intertitle: "Meeting with a writer." Second intertitle: "The Ukrainian State Folk Dance Troupe is performing." Narration about the writer: Youth from Dykan'ka coolective farm ( kolgosp in Ukrainian) [Ukrainian equivalent of 'kolkhoz'] welcome the honored writer Marietta Shaginyan. The writer took under her patronage "comsomolets" [younger members of the Communist Party] that responded to Stalin's call and are now going to work at railway transport. This demonstrates a very close relationship between writers and their audience of millions of Soviet readers.
