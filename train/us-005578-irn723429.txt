Selected records on activities of the office of the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral (Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland, OZAK), a district of Nazi Germany created in 1943 after Italian capitulation following the Allied invasion of Italy. Includes a fragmentary list of local residents detailed by German police. The area of the OZAK with its capital in Trieste comprised parts of the territories of present-day Italy, Slovenia, and parts of Croatia (Rijeka region). Odilo Globocnik served as Higher SS and Police Leader of this district in 1943-1945 and in this capacity oversaw all major activities of the local SS and Police, including administration of the concentration camps, deportations of the local population, and anti-partisan warfare.
