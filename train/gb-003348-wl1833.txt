Michael Siegel was born in Arnstein in 1882, the son of farmer and horse trader, Salomon Siegel. He received the KÃ¶nig Ludwig Kreuz in 1916 for his work with young people during the First World War. He married Mathilde Waldner (1893-1970) in 1920 with whom he had two children, Hans-Peter (born 1921) and Maria Beate (born 1925). After graduating in law at the universities of Munich and Berlin he joined the long established law firm of his relatives in Munich. He worked in the business until anti-Jewish laws prevented him from doing so in 1938. He was an active member of the Jewish community and acted as emigration advisor in 1939. Michael and Mathilde Siegel emigrated to Lima, Peru, in September 1940 where they arrived two months later. Their children were already in England by 1938. Michael Siegel led the German Jewish community "Sociedad de Beneficencia Israelita de 1870" in Lima between 1942 and 1957 and co-founded B'ai B'rith Lima in 1994.
