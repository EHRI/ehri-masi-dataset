Nazis are forced to replace desecrated tombstone. Former Hitler Youths and German prisoners-of-war replace a Hebrew-inscribed tombstone on a grave in Mulheim, Germant, May 21, 1945, under supervision of 17th Airborne Division troops of the 15th U.S. Army. The stome was removed from a Jewish cemetery by Nazi vandals during a reign of terror and descreation prior to capture of the town by U.S. forces. Mulheim is a Rhine River city 12 miles north of Dusseldorf.
