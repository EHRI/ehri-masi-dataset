Paul Tauchner and his wife, Diana (née Horowicz), are children of parents who survived the Holocaust in Poland. He acquires Nazi-era collections at auction in order to keep such material publicly available. He lives in Munich and works as a patent and trademark attorney in chemistry and pharmacology.

The Paul Tauchner document collection primarily documents restrictions on Rosa Block (1867‐1942) as a Jewish woman in Germany, and it also includes photographs of Karl Hermann Frank, a postcard to someone interned at Theresienstadt, picture postcards depicting Adolf Hitler, and a form documenting Johanna Meisinger’s Aryan descent. Rosa Block materials include an identification card, a bulletin from the Jüdische Kultusvereinigung about restrictions on movable property of Jews, a solicitation for a mandatory contribution to the Jüdische Winterhilfe, a doctor’s bill, and correspondence documenting the Prussian State Bank’s efforts to expropriate bank shares from her and the requirement that her heirs after her death not be Jewish.
