German soldiers visit a coal mine

German soldiers tour a coal mine in the Ruhr. They pass a sign that reads "VII Sohle 609m" and watch a worker drilling coal. More shots of the extraction of coal. The coal is removed from the mine on small rail cars. The next scenes show an oil processing plant under construction and soldiers with drums and cans of oil/gas. This image fades into the image of tanks. Shots of a seaplane taking off on a patrol of the North Sea, with a dog perched atop one of the floats. Interior shots show the crew drinking some kind of beverage and the pilot at the wheel. The plane flies over a British ship but does not shoot at it. UFA logo.
