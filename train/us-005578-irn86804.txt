Consists of one memoir, 243 pages, entitled "And they do not toll the bells...": The story of the family of Dr. Hillél Friedmann, Chief Rabbi of Dombóvár," written by Erzébet Rab Friedmann, circa 1945-1948. In the memoir, Mrs. Friedmann describes the family's 1944 deportation from Dombóvár to the Kaposvár ghetto. In great detail, she describes her memories of Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, forced labor at an aircraft factory near Leipzig, and a forced march to Theresienstadt from which she was liberated. She and her daughter Judit, who remained together during these experiences, returned to Hungary after liberation. Her husband and younger daughter were murdered at Auschwitz. This memoir is an English-language translation of the original Hungarian memoir, published in 1948, and titled "És nem verik félre a harangot," which was translated by Judith Sollosy in 2006.
