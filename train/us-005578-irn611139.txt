The Independent Order of B’nai B’rith (Sons of Covenant) was established in New York in 1843 by a group of German Jews. B’nai B’rith of Austria was funded in 1894 and designated District no. 10 of the International Order of B’nai B’rith. Its jurisdiction comprised the entire Hubsburg Empire, including the loges of Moravia and Galicia. After WWI, B’nai B’rith was structurally reorganized to match Europe’s new territorial divisions: District 10 become the Federation of B’nai B’rith of Czechoslovakia, while District 12 was created in Austria under the leadership of S. Ehrmann. Officially named: Verband der Israelitischer Hummanitäts-Vereine B’nai B’rith fűr Ősterreich”, the B’nai B’rith union in Austria numbered six loges with 862 members in 1932. It published a bulletin “Bnai Brith Mitteilungen fűr Ősterreich” edited by Dr. Arnold Ascher.
