Bernard Nissenbaum (born Berysz Bernard Nissenbaum) was born on 18 July 1895 in Łódź, Poland. He worked as a diamond cutter before the war. He was arrested and deported from a village in southern France in 1942, and survived several concentration and labor camps including Pawiak, Drancy, Lyon-Venissieux, Majdanek, Trzebinia, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, and Dachau. He was liberated from the Dachau concentration camp by the U.S. Army. Bernard immigrated to the United States in 1947 aboard the SS Marine Tiger.

The testimony describes Bernard Nissenbaum's deportation from France and his imprisonment in several concentration and labor camps during the Holocaust. The testimony includes detailed descriptions of conditions in the Trzebinia camp, the status and treatment of wealthy Jews as compared with other inmates, the division of various nationalities of prisoners in the Birkenau camp, the situation of the "Muselmänner" in various camps, the relationships between Kapos and inmates, and conditions in the ghetto in Warsaw, Poland, prior to the uprising. Bernard wrote the testimony around 1945-1946, primarily in German. His sister Gussie Weiner translated it into English around 1982.
