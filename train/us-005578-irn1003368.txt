Atrocity in Riga; Riga synagogue burns

According to the narrator, an atrocity committed by the retreating Soviets against Latvian nationalists in the Riga area. View of a building, then people carrying corpses on stretchers and laying them out in a row on the grass. Civilians looking at the bodies and weeping; many women. A woman in a flowered dress lays a body in a coffin. Close-up of a woman weeping. Bodies of children. Latvian civilians beating Jews they hold responsible for the atrocity. They drag a man across the street. Many German soldiers in the street watching the Jews being beaten. A burning synagogue in Riga. The narrator suggests that the Soviets had spared the synagogue while destroying the rest of the town, but the citizens destroyed it as revenge for the atrocity committed by the Soviets/Jews.
