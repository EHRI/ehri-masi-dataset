Jewish Chronicle library collection: Defence file

6 boxes

The collection consists of materials from the Jewish Chronicleâ€™s library that deal with the defence against antisemitism. These include reports on antisemitic groups, individuals and incidents, as well as on the bodies that fought against them. There are letters to the Jewish Chronicle on&nbsp;defence, both from anti-fascist groups reporting occurrences of antisemitism, and from representatives of the far-right denying charges of anti-Jewish prejudice or exhibiting their antisemitism through hate mail. The collection also contains transcripts of German media reports on various Nazi leaders. About half of the collection is comprised of publications of far-right, antisemitic and nationalist groups (or those suspected of being such), as well as those produced by antifascist and Jewish organisations.&nbsp;
