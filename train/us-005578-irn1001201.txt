New Cabinet Meeting in Berlin

Nighttime march of SS, SA, and stormtroopers. Hitler spotlit in upper window of Reichstag. Soft, murky tracking shots of crowd, torches, flags. A little hard to see, but creates an interesting atmosphere with the sounds and the swarming spotlight. Inside the Hotel Kaiserhof, before the Cabinet meeting begins. Everyone in suits, gathered around, mingling, a bit disorganized. Posing for their first official photograph. Cabinet members include (according to BA documentation): Hitler, Goering, von Papen, Seldte, Gerecke, von Schwerin Krosigk, Frick, von Blomberg, and Hugenberg. More shots of crowd outside, singing the German national anthem.
