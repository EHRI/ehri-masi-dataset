The various County Commissions on Establishing the Crimes of the Occupying Forces and Their Local Helpers during the war were established throughout Croatia, as well as the region of Dalmatia, following the end of the war. Direct perpetrators (1945/1946) were usually tried in ad hoc trials and executed. The controversy of trials in the immediate after-war period unfortunately sometimes overshadowed the anti-fascist victory.
