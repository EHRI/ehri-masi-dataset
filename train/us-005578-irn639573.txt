Documents, correspondence, and photographs illustrating the experiences of Chaim (born in Przemysl, Poland) and his wife Kreindl Kirschbaum (born in Jaroslav, Poland) and their children Anna, Lily, Joseph and Celia who all lived in Vienna, Austria, fled to Switzerland in 1939, and then forced to France where they were eventually sent to internment camps. Celia and Joseph were able to immigrate to the United States in 1940. The remaining family, according to documents included, state that Chaim died in a Paris hospital, too weak to tarvel, and his wife and two daughters were deported from Beune-la-Rolande internment camp in France to Auschwitz-Birkenau on August 5, 1942, where they are presumed to have perished. The collection includes an "affidavit in lieu of passport" issued by U.S. State Department authorities in France, naturalization papers, and birth certificates.
