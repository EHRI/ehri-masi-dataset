I'm An American -- César Saerchinger

On June 15, 1941 César Saerchinger spoke with William H. Marshall, Assistant District Director of Immigration at Ellis Island, about why the preservation of democracy is important. Saerchinger shares his immigration story. He reveals that in a totalitarian government citizens do no have the right to choose one’s work. Searchinger criticizes the out of date ideas of the Nazi regime. He says, “One country cannot be safe and strong so long as other countries are deprived of the means of livelihood for their people.” The musicologist suggests Europe be remodeled in a similar fashion as the United States. He says, “It is easier to spread truth than silence it,” because history has shown truth never dies. He concludes the program by stating that he believes the radio is the ideal instrument of democracy, because it has the power to travel great distances reaching audiences quickly. César Saerchinger was born on October 23, 1884 in Aix-la-Chapelle, France. He emigrated to the United States in 1898 and became a naturalized citizen in 1910. Saerchinger studied music with private teachers and began contributing to music magazines at 28-years-old. In 1919, he returned to Europe as a foreign correspondent for the New York Post. Saerchinger became the European director of the Columbia Broadcasting System from 1930 to 1937. He is credited with being the first to organize and systemize transatlantic broadcasting. The musicologist returned to America to broadcast “The Story Behind the Headlines” for the National Broadcasting Company from 1938 to 1948. Saerchinger went on to head Friedberg Management, which represented distinguished musicians and ensembles around the country.
