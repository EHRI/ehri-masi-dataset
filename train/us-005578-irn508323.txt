The collection contains materials assembled by Isaac and Masha Chomski before, during, and after World War II. The materials primarily deal with the Chomskis' efforts in evacuating 111 children from occupied France in 1941. Over the course of four days and five nights, and with the assistance of the US Committee for the Care of European Children, Å’uvre de secours aux enfants (OSE), the American Friends Service Committee, and a variety of persons and organizations in France, Spain, Portugal, and the United States, Isaac and Masha Chomski chaperoned the group of children over three thousand miles. The Chomskis chaperoned the first USCOM transport that evacuated children on the SS Mouzinho, which brought them to the United States in June 1941. Also included are oral history audio tapes of both Isaac and Masha Chomski detailing Jewish ghetto and shtetel life during the intewar period, as well as their escape from France.
