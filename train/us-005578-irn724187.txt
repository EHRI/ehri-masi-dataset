Marila Muszynski (Muszyński) was born in Kraków, Poland to Isador and Ester (née Rotarnow) Muszyński. Her father owned an electric battery factory, and she had an older brother, Marcel. The family was forced to leave Poland to Soviet-held territory. They were later deported to a Siberian labor camp near a gold-mining town called Aldan. After the war, Marila and her family arrived in Paris as displaced people. They eventually immigrated to the United States.

The Marila Muszynski papers consist of postcards, poems, and letters. Six postcards, handwritten in pencil by Marcel Muszynski, brother of Marila Muszynski, to Marila and her father, from Russia. Other materials created by Marcel are also included, such as multiple poems handwritten in pen on what appears to be a ledger page and other paper fragments and a handwritten letter, folded five times to form a neat triangle.
