Philip Solomon was born in Franklin, New Hampshire, to Max and Dora Solomon who were Lithuanian immigrants. He graduated from the Tilton School and the University of New Hampshire, and after completing medical school at Syracuse University in June 1941, he joined the U.S. Army's 439th Anti-Aircraft Battalion as a battalion surgeon. Dr. Solomon served with the Army in North Africa, Italy, southern France, and Germany. After World War II, he returned to the United States and became an obstetrician in N.J. Dr. Philip Solomon passed away in 1979.

The three-page letter was written in Munich, Germany, and sent from Dr. Philip "Pinny" Solomon [donor's father], a physician in the U.S. Army, to his parents, Max and Dora Solomon, who lived in the United States. In the letter Pinny discusses his search for and discovery of his cousin, Jakob Ben-Zion Feinstein, who had been a prisoner in Dachau concentration camp.
