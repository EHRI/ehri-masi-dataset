Bernard Michel (known as Borish) was born Jaunuary 15, 1866. He lived in Merxheim an der Nahe prior to deportation with his wife Elvine Josef Michel, from Luxembourg in 1942 to Theresienstadt, where they died. Their son Walter and his wife Blanche (nee Sekler) were also deported from Luxembourg. They died in Auschwitz as did Bernard's sons Solomon Michel (deported from France), Berthold and wife Fayga (nee Benedik) (deported from The Netherlands), Jakob and wife Charlotte (Lotte, nee Loeb) (deported from France), and grandson Werner (deported from Belgium).

The Bernard Michel collection consists of passport photographs of Elvire Michel (nee Josef) and Bernard Michel, circa 1940. They were eventually deported to Theresienstadt, where both perished.
