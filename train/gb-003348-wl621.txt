Adolf Eichmann Trial: Transcripts and other papers

4 boxes

The provenance of the papers relating to Adolf Eichmann's trial at 621/1-2, 4-5 is unknown.

This document collection contains two separate archival fonds. The Eichmann trial papers include verbatim transcripts of the trial proceedings and of the Eichmann appeal proceedings. They are copies of simultaneous translations and as such may not be completely accurate. Full transcripts of the trial and appeal proceedings are at 621/1-2. Incomplete copies of the same are at 621/4-5. The copies, translations and transcriptions of mainly Nuremberg documents which are evidence of Eichmann's involvement in the extermination of European Jewry at 621/3 were deposited by the Institute of Jewish Affairs (now the Institute for Jewish Policy Research) in September 1983. This is an artificial collection in which the papers have been arranged according to country.
