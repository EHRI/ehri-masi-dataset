Robert Heuck (1892-1964) was born in Cincinnati to German immigrant and vaudeville theatre-owner Hubert Heuck and was raised bilingually in the German neighborhood called “Over-the-Rhine.” He fought in the US Army during World War I, was elected Hamilton County recorder and auditor as a reform politician in the 1930s, and reportedly lampooned Hitler with an amateur vaudeville act in 1939. He re-enlisted in the army in July 1942, attended military government school in Charlottesville, and served as an American military governor in Zwickau from April to June 1945.
