Contains nine postcards, dated July18-23, 1942, written by Salli, Eva, Helma and Alfred Israel (donor’s paternal great uncles), to their governess Sibilla Klaus, a non-Jewish woman, during their last journey from Cologne, Germany to Minsk where they were murdered in Maly Trostinetz upon arrival. The first postcard was sent from Cologne and the rest were sent on route: Berlin, Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), Warsaw, Brest Litovsk at the Russian border, and after arriving in Minsk. Includes an envelope in which Albert Marx (donor’s father) kept these postcards, bearing an inscription: “The last regards from loved ones.” Also includes three photographs of Michael Max and Henrietta Marx (Albert Marx's parents) in 1939, Alfred Israel (donor’s father’s cousin), and a family portrait of the Israel family. Albert’s father, Michael Max Marx, was on the same transport to Minsk as the Israel brothers.
