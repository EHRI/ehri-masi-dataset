I'm An American -- Hans Kindler

On May 11, 1940, Kindler spoke with James L. Houghteling, Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization Service, on the the NBC radio broadcast "I'm An American" about his experience in the United States. The two men discuss American ideals of democracy and the value of the foreign-born citizens. Houghteling asks Kindler about antagonism to assimilate. Kindler states America impoverishes itself when immigrants are asked or expected to forget their cultural backgrounds and traditions; because possibilities of mutual understanding and contributions are being thrown away. Hans Kindler also explains how The Great Depression allowed the immigrant and American communities to grow together. Dr. Johannes Hendrikus Philip “Hans” Kindler was born in Rotterdam, Holland. In 1914, he traveled to New York to visit his mother, however the outbreak of WWI kept him from returning home. Kindler stayed in America and went on to play the cello; as well as cooperatively form the National Symphony Orchestra in 1930.
