The Henry Schimmel collection consists of documents, affidavits, and correspondence related to Henry Schimmel's post-war assistance with the emigration efforts of his relatives who had survived the Holocaust. Mr. Schimmel, who immigrated from Uzhorod, Czechoslovakia in the 1920s, contacted various relief organizations and government officials to intervene and assist with the immigration of his sister, Jolan Rozenbaum, her children Andy, Ella, and Katherine, and his nephew, David Silberstein, all of whom had survived the Holocaust.
