Okru≈æna uprava narodnih dobara Banjaluka

one book, 14 boxes

The fond contains records about property and goods, land, buildings, companies, etc that were nationalized and became the state property under Communist Yugoslavia, right after World War 2. In some cases, not only property of Germans and their collaborators became state property, but also the state managed properties of those who were killed during the war (in concentration camps, etc.) or their whereabouts were unknown. In case of Jewish people, the state introduced state-management of their properties either until legal inheritors claimed the property in question, or permanently in cases when no potential claimants survived the Holocaust.
Similar Offices were established all around Yugoslavia after 21.st of November 1944 (Third AVNOJ conference in Belgrade).
