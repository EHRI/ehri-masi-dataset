"Victims of Bolshevik Terror"

CU, women, crying. Bodies laid out (victims of the Soviets). International press visits the site. CU, personal effects of victims; clothing, photographs, papers, documents, all laid out on tables. Table of religious artifacts and relics (crosses, crowns, etc.) Translation of Ukrainian narration: European press representatives are shown the place of mass executions so they could be convinced of the barbaric tortures Ukrainian people were put through. These are the pits where victims are buried. Letters and other possessions of the tortured are used to help people to identify the dead. Items that are found with the dead prove that simple possession of a German book, German picture, church stamp or any other church artifact is enough to get a bullet from the Jewish-Bolshevik butchers. This is how freedom looks like in this so-called "freest country in the world." This footage was most likely shot either by a member of the OUN or a Ukrainian collaborator. This is believed to be the case because the term "Jewish-Bolshevik butchers" is used as a comment to emphasize the Jewish roots of the Bolsheviks. The word "zhyd" is used, which is an offensive term in both the Ukrainian and the Russian language. (Though in Polish "zhyd" literally means "Jew" without any offensive connotations.) Ukrainian nationalists often referred to the Soviet regime using the term "Jewish Bolshevik regime."
