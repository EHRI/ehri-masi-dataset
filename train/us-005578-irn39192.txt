United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

The Davidovits family collection consists of photographs and documents concerning the Davidovits family (donor's mother and extended family) in Sighet, Romania; many images document a visit by Evelyn and her mother Regina who traveled from the United States for an extended visit to Sighet in the early 1930s to visit Regina's immediate family and their children. The majority of Regina's family were eventually deported from Sighet to the Auschwitz concentration camp.
