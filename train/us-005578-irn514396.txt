Hana Kovanic was born in Velká nad Velickou in Moravia, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) on May 17, 1936, to Josef and Josefka Dubovy. In 1941 Hana, her parents, and two brothers were sent to Sered labor camp in Slovakia where they worked until September 1944 when a Slovak uprising liberated the camp. The family hid on a farm for a short period and then attempted to return to Josef's hometown, but they were arrested in December 1944. Hana's father and older brother were deported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany, and Hana, her mother, and younger brother were sent to Theresienstadt (Terezin) where they were liberated in May 1945

The 67 photographs depict the Kohn family, the maternal relatives of Hanna Kovanic, who were from Velká nad Velickou in Moravia, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic). Most of the relatives depicted in the photographs perished in Auschwitz in 1943 and 1944.
