Otto Eidlitz (born ca. 1925) was born to János (b. 1890) and Ilona Eidlitz in Budapest, Hungary and had two brothers, György (born ca. 1921) and Tamás (born ca. 1923). János was born in Nebraska, but he moved back to Hungary with his parents in the early 1890s. Otto lived in Hungary and worked as a leather worker. Before being imprisoned as a foreign prisoner in the Miranda del Ebro prison, Otto spent time at a boarding school in Spain while his parents were trying to obtain visas to the United States or Cuba. After Otto was released from prison, he sold everything to help get his brothers out. In April 1943, Otto and his brothers left from Lisbon, Portugal aboard the SS Serpa Pinto to the United States. They were sponsored by their uncle, Moritz Eidlitz, with whom they lived in Newark, New Jersey.

The Otto Eidlitz diaries consist of three diaries written by Otto Eidlitz between 1940 and 1943. The diaries cover the period of his escape from Hungary to Spain and his time in the Miranda del Ebro prison. The diaries also include his handwritten Hungarian to Spanish dictionary.
