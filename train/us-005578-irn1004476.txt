Anti-Polish propaganda just prior to outbreak of war

Excerpts from the last newsreel before the outbreak of war. Women and children who have allegedly suffered at the hands of the Poles are interviewed in a German refugee camp. A weeping woman tells her story. The ship Schleswig-Holstein arrives in Danzig harbor. Joyous civilians and members of the Kriegsmarine wave to the the ship from the shore. Men in formal navy dress uniforms leave the ship and review sailors lined up on the dock. A banner reads "Wilkommen Schleswig-Holstein". German draftees, still wearing civilian clothes, stand at attention at roll call, then are issued shoes and uniforms. The new inductees receive food and participate in activities including weapons training and horseback riding. Shots of military planes while the narrator says that Germany is ready to enforce its rights and freedom with all necessary measures. Shot of tanks riding across a field, horses pulling weapons, marching Wehrmacht troops, and German vessels on the water.
