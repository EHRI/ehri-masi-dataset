Bruening speaks

Title: "Germany can pay no more, says Dr. Bruening - Chancellor with dictatorship powers makes an important statement on reparations." Heinrich Bruening, seated at a desk, reads a prepared speech in English. He speaks of the hardships suffered by Germany and the punitive nature of Versailles. He ends with the statement that the war will never truly be over until "the account is closed and payment has been made in full." Bruening, the leader of the Catholic Center Party, served as German Chancellor from 1930 -- 1932.
