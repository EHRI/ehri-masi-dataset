Invasion of USSR

Title: Universal Newsreel Nazis War on Russia. Compilation of German and Soviet footage. Sound intermittent. Germans marching on parade, tanks, airplanes in formation, paratroopers parachuting out of planes. Brief shot of von Ribbentrop speaking. Happy peasants harvest crops, probably in the Ukraine. Tanks in Red Square, Soviet planes in the air, Soviet paratroopers, Molotov and Matsuoka sign the Japanese-Soviet non-aggression pact in April, 1941. Stalin stands in the background. In Washington, DC, at the embassy of the USSR, the Soviet Ambassador (?) makes a speech to the camera. He says that Hitler has miscalculated and that his attack on the USSR "will be smashed." A somber Sumner Welles gives a press conference (no sound). Also on this newsreel (beginning at 02:23:46): Title: U.S. Stars of Stage, Air and Screen Back War Loan Campaign. Crowds at a rally for war bonds.
