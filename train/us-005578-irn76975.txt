Adolph Rosenthal correspondence

folder

1

Contains three letters, plus two enclosures, between U.S. Representative Herman P. Kopplemann (1st district, Connecticut) and Adolph Rosenthal, of East Hartford, Connecticut, from January-February 1937, concerning the efforts of Mr. Rosenthal to obtain visas that would enable family members in Germany to immigrate to the United States. Kopplemann advised Rosenthal to provide as much information about his personal finances and property as possible, and the correspondence chiefly concerns the type of information needed in order to make the affidavit as convincing as possible.
