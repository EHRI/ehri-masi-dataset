Szlomo Salomon Depsztok (b. 1880) and his wife Syma Apelojg Depsztok immigrated from Warsaw, Poland, to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1926 with their four children: Leizer (Lazaro, b. October 19, 1913), Mosze (Moses, Motunken), Rosa (Róża, Różka), and Cyrla (Ceska). They maintained close contact with their Depsztok and Apelojg relatives in Warsaw, including during their confinement in the Warsaw ghetto. Most of their relatives are believed to have perished in the Holocaust.

The Depsztok and Apelojg families correspondence includes letters exchanged among members of the Depsztok and Apelojg families in Warsaw, Poland, and the Szlomo and Syma Depsztok family in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Most of the letters date between 1936 and 1939, and postcards from the Warsaw ghetto are dated 1941. The Warsaw relatives ask about the possibility of making a living in Argentina, thank the family in Argentina for sending money, and described being taken care of by Szlomo’s and Syma’s brothers and sisters. The postcards written from the Warsaw ghetto primarily describe hunger, ask for food packages, request more correspondence, and describe feelings of abandonment. The correspondence also includes a 1933 receipt from the Polish legation in Buenos Aires for 2.50 pesos paid by Cyrla Depsztok for certificates and a 1948 letter from Moshe Apelojg explaining how he was related to the Depsztok and Apelojg families.
