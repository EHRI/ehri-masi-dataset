Fritz Levy (Friedrich Levy, 1890-1954) was born on 1 May 1890 in Cologne, Germany to Siegmund (1848-1920) and Bertha (née Lowenberg, 1856-1915) Levy. He had two brothers, Otto and Ernst. Fritz’s father Siegmund owned a high-end hat manufacturing business called S. Levy and Sie. Fritz served as an officer in the German Army officer during World War I, and was captured in 1915. He remained a prisoner of war in Omsk until the end of the war, but was able to write to his family often. Fritz married Käte Lustig in 1923. Their daughter Lotte Edith (later Lotte Hamburger, 1924-2012) was born in 1924. Fritz and his brothers Ernst and Otto inherited their father’s hat manufacturing business in Cologne. In 1933, after learning about his daughter Lotte getting in trouble in school for refusing to sing Nazi songs, Fritz and Käte made plans to emigrate from Cologne to England. They sent Lotte to Leipzig to live with Käte’s parents and attend a Jewish school. Fritz and Käte immigrated to London later that year, and Lotte joined them in 1934. Fritz continued to work in the hat manufacturing business, primarily with Rivoli Hats Ltd. His brother Otto left Germany in 1937, but his other brother Ernst was paralyzed and unable to leave. They were forced to sell their business in Cologne in 1939 at a loss. Fritz and Käte helped her parents immigrate to England in 1939. They also helped other relatives emigrate from Germany including Käte’s sister Alice, and her aunt Trudi. Käte would later become the director of Kangol Hats Ltd. and Bergmann & Co. Ltd. Lotte immigrated to the United States in 1953. She married Joseph Hamburger in 1954, and they had three children, Philip, Jeffrey, and Annette.
