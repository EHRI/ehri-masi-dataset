During the second meeting of AVNOJ, on 21st of November 1944 a decision was made to seize all property of enemies of the state, and to introduce state management over properties of absent persons, as well as manage and resolve the status of properties seized by occupying powers during World War 2. Thus, in April of 1945. the State Office for people's goods of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed and all immovable goods and rights, land property, houses, furniture, forests, mining rights, companies, valuables, stocks, etc were under its management. The goal was to use these assets to maximise their usefulness in fulfilling five year economic plan. Part of managed properties once belonged to Jews who perished in the Holocaust.
The Office was abolished in 1946.
