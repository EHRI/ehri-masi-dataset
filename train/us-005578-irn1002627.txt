Farewell to SS-Galicia Waffen Division

A parade is organized to send the newly-formed Waffen SS "Galicia" Division in Ukraine off for training. Large crowds attend, and a farewell speech is given by Dr. Otto von Wächter, the German governor of Galicia, in Lviv (Lvov, Lwow), Geramn occupied territory of Ukraine. This likely takes place in the summer of 1943, though the troops did not see action until early 1944. Ukrainian soldiers are presented with flowers by Ukrainian women in traditional dress. There is a clear display of Ukrainian nationalism alongside the Nazi pageantry. Large crowds gather in the city square to bid the recruits farewell. CUs, faces in the crowd. Several Nazi flags are flying over the square. Young men march in formation, most in civilian clothes, as they have just volunteered for military service. New recruits board trains for journey to the front, and receive a huge send-off from fellow Ukrainians. The Galician SS Division would later go on destroy a few Polish villages in Galicia, and then to help quell uprisings in Yugoslavia and Slovakia. Translation of Ukrainian narration: In Lviv, SS brigade governor Dr. Otto von Wächter bids farewell to the volunteers of SS-Galicia Waffen who are leaving for further training. Celebration in front of the Lviv theatre. One more train with volunteers is leaving. Upon their return they will fight together with Germans to protect Europe against the Bolshevik enemies.
