Collection of correspondence written by Simon Marcks (donor's paternal grandfather) in Germany to his children (donor's parents) who were able to leave Germany in 1938 to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe); dated February 1940 - January 1942; in German. Simon Marcks was unable to leave Germany due to financial reasons. His wife Zilla (Karoline) died of natural causes, but Simon along with his three sisters, was deported from Dusseldorf to Theresienstadt on July 22, 1942. On September 21, 1942, he was deported to Treblinka and is presumed to have been killed upon arrival, as there were no survivors from that transport.
