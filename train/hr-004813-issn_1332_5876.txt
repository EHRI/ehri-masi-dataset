Å½idov

A weekly magazine (1917-1941)

"The Jew" touched on the daily politics in interwar Yugoslavia (following the goings-on in its capitals) and how the everyday politics touched upon Jews in all areas of Yugoslavia. Secondly, it kept up a continuous 'intergationist' (assimilationist) vs Zionist debate, clearly standing on the side of the latter; thirdly it followed anti-Semitic incidents in the country, as well as news from the Jewish worlds outside of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
