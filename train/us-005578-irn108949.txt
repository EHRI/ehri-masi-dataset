folder

1

The collection includes a journal, documents, and photographs illustrating the experiences of sisters Esther and Helen (b. 1918) Mermelstein, born in Cinadievo, Czechoslovakia (currently Ukraine) and deported to the Munkacs ghetto in April 1944. In June 1944 they were sent to a series of concentration camps including Auschwitz, munitions factory Christianstadt, a sub-camp of Gross Rosen, in Poland, and Bergen-Belsen in Germany where they were liberated. They were then sent to Karlstad, Sweden to recuperate. The journal is a multi-page letter from Helen to brother Heshkel [Alexander] and the photographs were taken pre-war in Sweden.
