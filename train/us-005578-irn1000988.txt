Ferencz: International Criminal Tribunal, Rwanda

Hosts: Richard Roth and James Bone, Times of London, United Nations Program discusses setting up an international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. Participants include John Shattuck, US Assistant Secretary of State for human rights in Rwanda, Cherif Bassiouni, expert on war crimes allegedly committed in Yugoslavia, and Benjamin Ferencz, prosecutor of Nuremberg War Crimes Trial. Ferencz states that it is "high time" for the international community to react and enforce law so that genocide can no longer be tolerated. It is the determination of the international community to maintain peace. At the same time, we cannot trade justice and peace. Bassiouni agrees, arguing for a permanent international criminal court instead of tribunals. Ferencz notes that the general principles declared at Nuremberg, affirmed unanimously by the United Nations, are not implemented.
