Rise of Nazi party

Frank Capra was an Italian American film director, producer, and writer born in Italy and raised in Los Angeles from the age of five. Capra became one of America's most influential directors during the 1930s, winning three Academy Awards for Best Director from six nominations, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations in other categories. Among his leading films were "It Happened One Night" (1934), "You Can't Take It with You" (1938), and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). Capra served in the US Army during World War I and became naturalized shortly thereafter. He reenlisted after Pearl Harbor and was offered a commission as a Major at the age of 44. Chief of Staff George Marshall bypassed the US Army Signal Corps and assigned Major Capra the job of producing seven propaganda films (the Why We Fight series) that would be seen less as propaganda pieces and more as the inspiring films that Capra had made. After World War II, Capra's career declined as his later films, such as "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), performed poorly when they were first released. Outside of directing, Capra was active in the film industry, engaging in various political and social issues. He served as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, worked alongside the Writers Guild of America, and was head of the Directors Guild of America.

US propaganda film about "The German personality" and its national psyche and history. Reel 5 shows the Weimar parliament in session; German troops parading; Hitler; Nazi riots and mobs; and CUs of Goebbels, von Schirach Goering, and Hess. The NARA shot sheet mistakenly identifies von Schirach as Roehm, and the narration describes him as a "pervert" so perhaps the mistake was made by the filmmakers. Describes Hitler's rise to power, installation as chancellor, and one-party rule. SS troops parade, Nazi propaganda, books are burned, and Hitler speaks while Germans cheer.
