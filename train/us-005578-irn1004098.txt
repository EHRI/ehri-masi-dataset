Excerpt from a film which compares traditional Roma life unfavorably with the life of the Roma under the Soviet system. Intertitle in English and French reads, "Awards for the Best Workers." Romani people on a kolkhoz (collective farm) receive awards at a ceremony. People clap and cheer as a woman is awarded three geese and a young boy receives a pig. A woman and a man lead a bull through a crowd of cheering people. A large portrait of Stalin hangs from the building. Intertitle in English and French reads: "The Century-Long Wanderings of the Gypsy." A Roma woman dances in front of a large crowd. Shots of individuals in the crowd.
