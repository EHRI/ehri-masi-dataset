These diaries are thought to have been kept by Felix Langer, the German journalist and author. A postcard addressed to him was found in one of the diaries.

Felix Langer was born in Bruenn, Moravia (Brno, Czec Republic) on 18 June, 1889 and died London 1980. He studied law and political science at the university of Vienna; was a lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army during WWI; and was a director of relief work for POWs in Siberia at the end of the war. Between 1920 and 1933 he worked as a journalist and writer in Berlin. He was an author of stage and radio plays and film scripts. He was also a contributor to Berliner Tageblatt, among other papers. He emigrated to Bruenn in 1933 where he was a regular contributor to a number of newspapers. In 1939 he emigrated to Great Britain where he became an active member of Club 43, and wrote a number of books, including his best known, <em>Stepping Stones to Peace</em>, (London, 1942).

The diaries contain mostly sparse notes often barely legible. A large part of the content relates to books.
