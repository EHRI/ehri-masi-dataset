Impact of Marshall aid on Germany

This description of the film "Me and Mr. Marshall" is from the "Selling Democracy: Films of the Marshall Plan, 1948-1953" program: The impact of Marshall aid is told personally by a young German coal miner. He describes (and the viewer sees) conditions in Europe after the war and some of the ways the Marshall Plan helped Europe get back into production and into the import-export business. Footage includes Secretary of State George Marshall describing the way the European Recovery Program is supposed to work (a re-enactment - not the June 5, 1947, Harvard speech). Also includes animated graphic of the distribution of Marshall Plan monies.
