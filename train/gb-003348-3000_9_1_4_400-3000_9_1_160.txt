Correspondence with Biss, Andreas

38 letters

Andreas Biss was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor. During the Second World War he was, along with Resző Kasztner, part of the Aid and Rescue Committee in Budapest and tried to safe Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust. Since the late 1950s he lived in West Berlin.

The correspondence centres on Biss’ view on the Aid and Rescue Committee in Budapest. Light is thrown on his efforts in writing a book on this subject, a meeting with Alfred Wiener in Berlin, the sending of source material on this topic, and a related article Biss authored for The Wiener Library’s Bulletin. The correspondence also contains a brief expert report by H. G. Adler on an early version of Biss’ manuscript.
