Ojser Salpeter (Oskar, b. 1884) was born on January 20, 1884 in Radomyśl, Poland (present-day Ukraine). Brunhilde Salpeter (Bronia/Breindl, née Issler, b. 1891) was born on April 28, 1891 in Radomyśl. Oskar and Brunhilde Salpeter married in Dortmund, Germany on August 26, 1919. They moved to Düsseldorf, Germany where their four daughters were born: Klara Salpeter (May 30, 1923- ), Rieka Salpeter (Rika, November 8, 1925- ), Dorothea Salpeter (Dora, February 24, 1928- ), and Charlotte Salpeter (Lotte, April 8, 1930- ). In 1938, Klara Salpeter immigrated to the United States. On October 29, 1938, the Salpeter family was forced out of Germany into Poland, along with thousands of other Polish Jews. The family was forced to travel from town to town including Poznań, Tarnów, and Mielec. Klara Salpeter last heard from her family in late 1941. They are presumed to have perished in either Belzec or Auschwitz concentration camp.
