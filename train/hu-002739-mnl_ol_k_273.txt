Alapszabálygyűjtemény (1941-1944)

11 boxes, 1,32 linear metres

The Collection of Statutes includes the statutes of a host of various associations, such as burial societies or pensioners clubs, for the years 1941 to 1944. It includes the statutes of Jewish associations operating in Hungary at this time as well. The collection is of special importance for the study of the process of anti-Semitic discrimination and exclusion, on the one hand, with question such as in what ways were attempts of Jewish self-organization restricted and under what conditions were Jewish associations allowed to continue to function. On the other, the statutes also reveal Jewish responses and attempts at self-assertion in these years. Since the Holocaust in Hungary was the last major chapter of the Europe-wide genocide against European Jewry, 1941 to 1944 are of special significance from an international point of view as well: these were the years of the implementation of the Nazi genocide against the Jews outside the borders of the country and a period of freightened hoping, despite significant losses, of the Hungarian Jewish community to have the chance to continue to live on an island of relative safety. The collection includes many of their statutes in their original and there are copies of them as well.
