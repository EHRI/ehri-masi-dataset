Viktor Ullmann (01/01/1898-18/10/1944) was born in Teschen. He was interested in music at an early age and, after a brief period on the Italian front in the First World War, started studying law at Vienna University. At the beginning of 1918, he began attending Sch√∂nberg's seminar on composition. In May 1919, he left university to pursue his musical career in Prague, where he came under the influence of Alexander von Zemlinksy. He found success as a conductor and a composer, as well as a reviewer, lecturer and teacher. On 8 September, he was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp. He was able to continue performing and playing. On 16 October, he was deported to Auschwitz, where he was murdered two days later.
