Körrendeletek (1867-1942)

17 fasc., 3 vols., 2,6 linear metres

This collection includes circular decrees (körrendeletek) of the Ministry of Finance for the years 1867 to 1942. The last four to five years covered by the collection, i.e. the late 1930s and early 1940s, is relevant for the study of anti-Semitic radicalization in Hungary since the anti-Semitic policies of the times were initated not only by numerous major anti-Semitic laws adopted in Parliament but were also implemented through hundreds of decrees and such circulars from ministries with the Ministry of Finance playing a notable role. Circular decrees from those years may have had explicit anti-Semitic intentions or may have been implicitly anti-Semitic (i.e. could be and often were used for anti-Semitic purposes). The collection includes copies of the original circulars.
