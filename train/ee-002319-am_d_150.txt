4 records, alphabetical card files, book, original paper documents

This collection of documents was found by Soviet authorities in September 1944 in the deserted Klooga camp and used for investigation of a massacre that was carried out on 19 September 1944. In 1947 the Ministry of Justice of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic delivered the current collection to the Estonian History Museum; in 1962 the museum delivered a substantial part of the collection (including original prisoner card files and documents from the Nazi German authorities) to the Estonian State Archive (see EHRI database ERA.R-170). The rest of the collection consisted mainly from different private items of Jewish inmates (photos, letters, personal documents). In 1993 the museum delivered the main part from the rest of the collection to Yad Vashem in Israel.

This fonds is a small collection of documents of the Klooga concentration camp. Klooga (Arbeitslager Klooga) was a subcamp from Vaivara Concentration Camp network, subordinated to the SS Economic and Administrative Main Office. Current materials remained in Estonia after the Second World War and in 1947 were transferred to the Estonian History Museum.
