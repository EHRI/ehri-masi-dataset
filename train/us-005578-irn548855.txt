Contains materials related to Helene Wiesenberg (donor) and her experiences in the Theresienstadt Ghetto. Includes ration cards, work certificates stating that she participated in the delousing of arriving convoys, examples of camp scrip, and documentation granting her permission to leave Terezin in June 1945. Also includes a typewritten poem, dated March 1945, apparently written in observance of Passover Seder in Theresienstadt.
