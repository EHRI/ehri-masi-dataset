Raymond (Ray) Buch (1920-2010) was born in New York City to Ukrainian immigrants, Ludwig (1893-1962) and Mary (nee Straub, 1896-1939) Buch, and was raised on a farm in New Jersey. Ray had four siblings: June (1925-c. 2005), Mary (b.1930), Gloria (1932-2002), and Francis (1934-2011). After completing high school, Ray worked as a construction carpenter until he was drafted into the United States Army in 1942. Ray’s construction background led to his assignment in the 11th Armored Division’s (AD) 56th Armored Engineer Battalion. He went through training in Louisiana and Texas before being deployed to Great Britain in September 1944. His unit arrived in France on December 16, 1944, and went into combat in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. Ray was injured during this campaign, and was awarded the Purple Heart. The division continued across Europe to the Siegfried Line, the defensive line on the western border of Germany. The engineers were responsible for a variety of tasks to facilitate movement of the troops, including preparing roads, removing obstacles, building bridges, and clearing mines. Within the 2nd Platoon of Company A, Ray was one of the men who operated the mine detector equipment. In March 1945, the 11th AD entered the Rhineland campaign in Germany. In mid-April, Ray and his unit began encountering camp prisoners who were being force marched by SS guards. The guards fled, leaving behind a trail of corpses who died or were killed during the marches. Ray’s platoon was part of the 11th AD’s Combat Command A which was moving toward Linz, Austria. On May 5, they were removing dynamite from a bridge when Combat Command B liberated Mauthausen concentration camp and its former subcamp, Gusen. Ray and his platoon were still near Linz when Germany surrendered to the Allies. The war officially ended on May 9. The next day, Ray accompanied the bulldozer operators to Mauthausen to assist with the cleanup. While in the camp, Ray was able to film and photograph the scene, documenting the overcrowded barracks, the mass burials and the emaciated prisoners who were either clothed in rags or naked. The division was at Mauthausen for about 30 days before they were relieved by the 26th Infantry. Prior to their departure, the 11th began burning some of the buildings and backfilled the latrines and mass grave trenches. After Ray and his unit left Mauthausen, they were sent to Schwanenstadt to maintain roads and rebuild bridges. He also spent a few days guarding the prisoners in Ebensee, a former concentration camp converted to house SS prisoners, and was later sent to the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany. The division remained on occupation duty until they were inactivated on August 31, 1945 Ray returned to New Jersey after the war and went to work as a home contractor. He married Mary Louise Stout (1928-2006) in April 1951, and the couple had two children. Ray led the New Jersey chapter of the 11th Armored Division Association, became a unit historian, and served as the association President in 1974.

Richard McNamee Crossett (1926-2006) was born in Little Rock, Arkansas to Jesse (1893-1974) and Agnes (nee Dowden, 1899-1977) Crossett. Richard was living in Salt Lake City, Utah, when he was drafted into the United States Army in August 1944. Richard was assigned to the 56th Armored Engineer Battalion (AEB), of the 11th Armored Division. While deployed in Europe, the engineers were responsible for a variety of tasks to facilitate movement of the troops, including preparing roads, removing obstacles, building bridges, and clearing mines. The 56th AEB was deployed to Great Britain in September 1944, arrived in France on December 16, 1944, and went into combat in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. The division continued across Europe to the Siegfried Line, the defensive line on the western border of Germany. In March 1945, the 11th AD entered the Rhineland campaign in Germany. In mid-April, they began encountering camp prisoners who were being force marched by SS guards. The guards fled, leaving behind a trail of corpses who died or were killed during the marches. On May 5, Combat Command B, which included a group from the 56th AEB, liberated Mauthausen concentration camp and its former subcamp, Gusen. The war officially ended on May 9. The division was at Mauthausen for about 30 days before they were relieved by the 26th Infantry. Before leaving, the 11th began burning some of the buildings and backfilled the latrines and mass grave trenches. The division remained on occupation duty until they were inactivated on August 31, 1945. Richard returned to the United States in June 1946, and enrolled at the University of Arkansas to study commercial art. In 1948, he married Maurine McArthur. After completing school, they settled in Salt Lake City, where he worked as a graphic designer and later became vice president of an advertising agency. Richard also served in the army during the Korean War (1950-1953). Richard and Maurine had four children, and in 1962, moved to Louisville, Kentucky. Richard became a well-known heraldic artist, and belonged to The American College of Heraldry and The Society of Heraldic Arts.

Commemorative poster for the 11th Armored Division (AD), printed in honor of the division’s 46th birthday on August 15, 1988. It features colored depictions of the badges, shields, crests, and symbols of the various units that comprised the division, and memorializes the names of those killed in action. The poster was created by division historian Raymond (Ray) S. Buch, and heraldic artist Richard M. Crossett. Both men belonged to the 56th Armored Engineer Battalion, which entered combat in December 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge. On May 5, 1945, Ray and his platoon were near Linz, Austria, when another subgroup of the 11th AD found Mauthausen concentration camp and its former subcamp, Gusen. Soon after, Ray accompanied the bulldozer operators to Mauthausen to assist with the cleanup. While in the camp, Ray was able to film and photograph the scene, documenting the overcrowded barracks, the mass burials and the emaciated prisoners who were either clothed in rags or naked. After about 30 days, the 11th AD left Mauthausen and remained on occupation duty until they were inactivated on August 31, 1945.
