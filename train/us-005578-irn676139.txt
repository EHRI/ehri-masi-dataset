Collection of three black and white photographic prints with images depicting buildings being consumed by fire, behind barbed wire fence and closed gates with sign warning of typhus; two of the photos marked on verso with stamp by US Army Examiner, and handwritten caption of “Not for Publication / AEH” and “Gossezossen”; one image marked “Beyreuth” on recto across top. The photographs were taken by Staff Sgt Lewis Gutin (donor’s father) who served with the 9th Armored Engineer Battalion as Mess Sergeant. The images are unlabeled, but were possibly taken in Bergen-Belsen.
