Vino Liubi | Golubiye Glaza

Interwar Russian tangos by Latvian Jewish songwriters Mark Marianovsky (1889-1944) and Oscar Strok (1892-1975), recorded by internationally renowned interpreter of tango-songs Pyotr Leshchenko (1898-1954). Recorded in Vienna in 1933. Pyotr Leshchenko was a singer in the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union and is considered "the King of Russian Tango." This LP includes the original recording of the hit tango "Golubiye Glaza" (Sky-blue eyes) by Oskar Strok, the "Latvian Tango King." During World War II the tune was repurposed as a song about the special misfortunes of Jewish-Christian converts in the Warsaw ghetto; after the war it became "Vu ahin zol ikh geyn?" (Where shall I go?), the "anthem" of Europe's Jewish Displaced Persons.
