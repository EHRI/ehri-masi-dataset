Kriegsberichterstattung: Judenherrschaft in Sovj. Russland

War coverage in French addressing the Jew in the Soviet Union to illustrate that the war is about the Jews or was fomented by Jews. Bertrand Nicole, the war reporter/correspondent, speaking in French with a German accent, talks to a Russian woman who escaped the Soviet Union with her daughter with just the clothes on their backs, finding refuge in a camp run by the Waffen-SS. The Russian woman barely speaks any French (the interviewer finishes her sentences). The conversation is meant to demonstrate that the Jews are responsible for all of the ills that befall Russian citizens. For example, the subject of food distribution comes up and the Russian woman accuses the Jews of running the central food distribution outlets spread out across the Soviet Union. In other words, she implies that while the Soviets starve, the Jews "distribute" or allocate food among themselves, while Soviet people stand on line for days. The interviewer may have traveled to the camp to record the interview and may have been operating behind German lines on the Soviet front.
