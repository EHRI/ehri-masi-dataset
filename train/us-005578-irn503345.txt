Frey, Paul

Paul Frey, formerly known as Siegmund Freitag, a Polish Jew, had lived with his family in Essen, Germany prior to 08 Nov. 1938. After Kristallnacht (09-10 Nov 1938), they escaped to the Netherlands. After the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands, the entire family was placed in Westerbork concentration camp. They managed to stay at Westerbork until 18 Jan. 1944, when they were deported to Terezin concentration camp on transport number 211. Once in Terezin, they were again deported, this time to Auschwitz. Frey became separated from his mother and younger brother, but managed to stay with his father, Salomon Freitag, while at the camp. Both Salomon and Paul managed to escape while on a death march, and they were eventually liberated by the Soviet Army. Paul later immigrated to the United States.

Contains reports, photographs, passports, and various other documents relating to the Holocaust experiences of Paul Frey (born Siegmund Freitag), a Polish Jew, and his parents, Salomon and Gitl Freitag. Also relates to Frey's postwar status as a displaced person. Also included are Terezin banknotes (apparently acquired by donor sometime after his own incarceration in that camp); and a photo of an exhibition at Auschwitz that includes a suitcase left by Paul's father.
