Next to various levels of public administration and the Hungarian police forces, the Hungarian gendarmarie was the major organization responsible for the implementation of the Holocaust in Hungary in 1944. Its representatives ghettoized and deported Hungarian Jews from the countryside and often did so in a cruel and brutal manner. The 8th Gendarmerie district of Hungary was organized upon Hungary's (re)acquisition of territory from Czechoslovakia around the time of the latter's destruction. Records of the 8th gendarmerie district concern, above all, the processes of confiscation, processing, and distribution of Jewish property in Hungary in 1944. The collection contains reports, numerical data and other certificates regarding valuables stolen from Jewish individuals during the implementation of the Holocaust.
