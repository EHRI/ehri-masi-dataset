He had two sisters, Betti (later Betty Suessmann, 1896-1976) and Margot (1895-1943), and one brother, Walter (1901-1984). Frieda Therese Riesenfeld (née Schwabacher, 1908-2012) was born on 16 April 1908 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany to Emil (1873-1919) and Dora (née Schwabacher, 1881-1943) Schwabacher. She had one sister, Henny (1906-1918). Bruno and Frieda married in 1931, and their first son, Ernst, was born in 1935. Bruno owned a paint factory in Heidingsfeld, near Würzburg. In 1938, he was forced to sell his business and then arrested. Frieda helped secure his release, but he was arrested again several months later and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. After his release, they left Germany to go stay with Bruno’s sister Margot in Amsterdam while they continued to wait for U.S. visas. Their son, James was born 17 April 1939 in Amsterdam. On 14 March 1940 the family sailed out of Rotterdam for the United States on the Veendam. They settled in New York. Bruno’s sister Margot perished during the Holocaust at the Sobibór extermination camp in 1943. Frieda’s mother Dora was deported from Würzburg to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943 where she perished.
