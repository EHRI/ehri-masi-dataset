Michael Schwartz was born Miklosh Schwartz in 1928 in Debrecen, Hungary, to Peter and Gizella (n√©e Grosz) Schwartz. He had a younger brother, Tibor, and younger sister, Magda. Michael attended school, and was sometimes subjected to antisemitic taunts on his way to school. The family were proud Hungarians and the children were taught not to hold any religious prejudices. Their Christian nanny bought them a Christmas tree every year. In the early years of World War II, Peter Schwartz was sent to a forced labor battalion; he disappeared in December 1943. In the spring of 1944, the family was sent to a ghetto and from there, deported to Auschwitz. Michael and Tibor were selected for labor, while Gizella, Magda and Gizella's mother were murdered upon arrival. Soon thereafter, the brothers were sent to Dachau. At the end of April 1945, they were sent away from Dachau by train, but were liberated by the American army. After liberation, they returned to Hungary but quickly decided to go to the American occupation zone instead. With the help of an aunt in the United States, Michael and Tibor immigrated to America in 1947. He married Flo ("Angel") in January 1950, and became an American citizen in 1952. They couple had two daughters, Gail and Robyne.
