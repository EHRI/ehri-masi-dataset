Andrezja Axt Dubinsky escaped Poland during World War II, and moved back before eventually moving to the United States. Along with the assistance of Adam Rubaszewski, she translated Eliszewa (Elza) Binder's and Juliusz Feuerman's diaries; two Polish Jews from the Stanisławów ghetto. She also facilitated their publication by the Polish-Jewish Heritage Foundation.

The Stanislawów diaries and testimonies document life within the Stanislawów ghetto from 1941-1943. Eliszewa Binder’s diary was written by a young Jewish girl, between 1941 and 1942. Her given name was Elza, but she was called Eliszewa by her friends. The entries discuss life in the ghetto, and several entries are written by a friend, explaining the fate of her family to the Nazis. She was most likely murdered shortly after the last entry in June, 1942. Juliusz Feuerman was born in Stanislawów in 1889, and was educated as a building engineer. During WWI, he was seriously injured on the Italian front. He and his wife, Ida Rokach, were active members of the Zionist party. He was imprisoned for 9 months after the liquidation of the ghetto, from which he lost nine family members including his wife. He kept his diary while living in the ghetto and prison. His death most likely occurred several weeks before Stanislawów was liberated. The third part of these papers include various excerpts and testimonies from survivors of the Stanislawów ghetto, collected by Adam Rubaszewski.
