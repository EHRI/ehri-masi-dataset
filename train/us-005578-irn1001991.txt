Nazi feature film on espionage, British agents, German rearmament

Plot summary: In this feature film set in 1936, Mr. Morris operates a British espionage ring based in Berlin that is eager to receive information about secret German rearmament plans. He is successful when he bribes a broke engineer involved in the construction of a new artillery cannon and places an agent in a military airport testing a new type of bomber. However, when Morris deliberately makes the acquaintance with the girlfriend of Hans Klemm, a soldier running in new tanks, he encounters trouble. He initially makes some progress by utilizing the soldier's friendliness and naiveté, but after Morris tries to blackmail Klemm into further cooperation, the soldier reports to his superiors, enabling the Gestapo to uncover a wide network of spies. Morris is convicted of high treason by the Volksgerichtshof [court of the people; special NS-court] and executed in the penitentiary Plötzensee, while Klemm is praised by his commander for his vigilance and courage.
