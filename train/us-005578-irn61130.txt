Consists of one memoir, 76 pages, entitled "A Chronicle, 1923-1947," written by Samuel Gottesman, originally of Irshava, Czechoslovakia (now Ukraine). He describes pre-war religious life in a small town, and his town being rounded up and deported to the ghetto in Berehove in the spring of 1944. He describes life in the ghetto and their deportation to Auschwitz, where he was forced to work on various construction projects. In January 1945, when Auschwitz was evacuated, he was sent on a forced march and placed in a open rail car, finally arriving at Bergen-Belsen. In the spring of 1945, he was sent on a work detail, repairing rail lines damaged in bombing raids and was eventually liberated by the American Army. He wrote this memoir in 1982 and typed it in May 1994.
