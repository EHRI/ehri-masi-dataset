The Supreme National Tribunal (Najwyższy Trybunał Narodowy, NTN) was a war crimes tribunal active in Poland from 1946 to 1948. The Tribunal's aims and purpose were defined by the State National Council in the Decrees of 22 January and 17 October 1946 and 11 April 1947. The new law was based on the earlier Decree of 31 August 1944 (Sierpniówka) issued by the new Polish pro-Soviet government, with jurisdiction over Nazi criminals and traitors to the Polish nation. The tribunal presided over seven high-profile cases (Total of 49 individuals).

Contains investigation files, evidence, and court documents relating to the war crimes trial of Jürgen Stroop, the SS and police chief who crushed the Warsaw ghetto uprising and ordered the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto. Also includes materials on crimes committed by his assistants, Franz Konrad and Herman Hoefle. Jürgen Stroop was tried by American military authorities in Dachau in January 1947, then extradited to Poland. In July 1951 Stroop was tried at the Warsaw District Court and executed by hanging that September.
