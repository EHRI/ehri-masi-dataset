George Salton (1928-2016) was born Lucjan Salzman on January 7, 1928 in Tyczyn, Poland to Henry and Anna Salzman. He had one brother named Emil. In 1941, he was forced into the ghetto in Rzeszów and was transferred to the Rzeszów concentration camp in 1942. He was later deported to a number of camps, including Plaszów, Wieliczka, Colmar and Urbis (both subcamps of Natzweiler), Watenstedt (a subcamp of Neuengamme), Ravensbrück, and Wobbelin (a subcamp of Neuengamme). After liberation, he spent two years in various displaced persons camps in Germany before immigrating to the United States in 1948. While serving in the U.S. Army, he met Ruth Wolfberg, a fellow survivor. The couple married and raised three children in Rome, NY. After his retirement, he wrote a book, The 23rd Psalm: A Holocaust Memoir, and co-founded with his wife the Palm Beach chapter of Leah and later Insight, organizations dedicated to the education of young people about the Holocaust.
