I'm An American -- Walter Huston

On August 24, 1941 Walter Huston spoke with William H. Carmichael, District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, about democracy and how he captures the American spirit despite being foreign-born. Huston explains the difference between living in America and Canada. He explains why he came to the United States and why it was important to him to become naturalized. Huston offers suggestions on how America can defend democracy without guns. He also challenges Nazi ideals of democracy. He warns Americans not to take the privilege and responsibility of ruling themselves lightly. The actor declares let the abundance of America flow to everyone. The program concludes with Walter Huston stating, “Do we have to lose freedom to appreciate them?” Walter Huston (b. Walter Thomas Houghston) was born on April 5, 1883 in Toronto, Canada. He attended the Shaw School of Acting where he developed a love for the theatre, but his passion left him without a steady paycheck. The struggling actor briefly turned to engineering. Huston eventually decided to pursue his artistic passions on Broadway in the mid-1920s. He went on to have an established prolific career that lasted more than two decades with dozens of movies. Huston was nominated for four Academy Awards and won one for Best Supporting Actor in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre." The Huston family is held in high regard for their contributions to entertainment and art. The family is also credited with having three generations of Academy Award winners.
