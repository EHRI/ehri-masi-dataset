Contains an identification card issued by the "International Committee for Granting Relief to European Refugees" in Shanghai, China; certifies that Käthe Fränkel, born in Eisleben, Germany is registered as a “bona-fide Emigrant." Includes a pamphlet entitled “Good-bye Mr. Ghoya,” printed in September 1945 by Friedrich Melchior as a parody of all the stumbling blocks that Kanoh Ghoya, the Japanese civil administrator of the Bureau of Stateless Refugees Affairs in Shanghai, put in the way of the Jewish refugees who were forced to reside in the Hongkew Ghetto in Shanghai from 1943-1945.
