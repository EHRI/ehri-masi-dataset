Circular 15226 from 1919 established the scope of action for the Presidential Department of the Foreign Ministry. This scope consisted of setting the agenda and centrally administering the Ministry, organizing the diplomatic representation, employing the personnel of Hungarian foreign policy, assuring the acquisition of proper offices abroad as well as equiping and maintaining them, organizing foreign policy training related exams, preparing the etiquette for diplomats and consuls active in Hungary, deciding upon their rank and accommodation and, last but not least, taking care of letters of accreditation and the granting of decorations. In 1933, questions of protocol were assigned to the newly created Department of Protocol though in 1938, its task of issuing, extending and registering diplomatic passports and letters of recommendation were returned to the Presidential Department. The collection containing the records of the Presidential Department of the Foreign Ministry consists of three fonds, K 59 holding the largest amount of its documents. K 60 contains the papers of 1/S referral that concerned Hungarians abroad and work contracts in the international realm, developments in international social policy as well as the relation to the International Labor Organization and the International Red Cross. (The subjects covered partly overlap with the contents of K 69 and K 71 though these overlaps have been minimized and the documents moved have been specially marked.) K 61 contains documents regarding money transfers from abroad.
