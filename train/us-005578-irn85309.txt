Eric Bergtraun (1925-2008) was born Erich Maximilian Bergtraun in Vienna to Edmund Leon Bergtraun and Lilly Wagner Bergtraun. His family left Austria for Shanghai shortly after Kristallnacht in 1938 and was forced to live in the Hongkew Ghetto for three years as the war intensified. Eric was active in the underground British Boy Scouts and became Scout Master after the war. He immigrated to the United States in 1948, settled in San Francisco, and married Polly Bergtraun (nee Hertz).

The Eric Bergtraun papers consist of biographical materials, photographic materials, log books, and scrapbooks documenting Bergtraunâ€™s participation in Boy Scout activities as a Jewish refugee in Shanghai during and after World War II.
