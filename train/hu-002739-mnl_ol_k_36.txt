The correspondence was acquired by the Hungarian National Archives in 1948.

Béla Imrédy (1890-1946), Director of the Hungarian National Bank, Minister of Finance, Minister of Economic Coordination and subsequently Prime Minister of Hungary between 1938 and 1939. The first anti-Jewish law was adopted during his premiership. He initiated the Second Anti-Jewish Law in late 1938 that was meant to further limit the socioeconomic opportunities of Hungarian Jews and aimed to reduce Jewish involvement to a mere 6%. The law was eventually to be adopted under his successor Pál Teleki. In 1940, Imrédy left the governing party to launch his radical rightist party Party of Hungarian Renewal, which was part of the establishment but also a direct competitor to Ferenc Szálasi’s Arrow Cross. Imrédy was the Nazi’s first choice to become Prime Minister upon March 19, 1944 but was eventually to serve as Minister of Economic Coordination in the government of Döme Sztójay until August 1944. He was sentenced to death and executed in 1946. The collection contains a fragment of the semi-official correspondence of Béla Imrédy. The two main components are personal requests and greetings and the letters received by Imrédy upon launching the Hungarian Life Movement in 1939.
