Oswiez (Alexander/Sasha) Markon, was born on March 11, 1905, in Vilna, Poland (Vilnius, Lithuania). He emigrated to France in the 1920s. From 1927-1929, he served in the French Army. Around 1936, Alexander became engaged to Raya Magid (1910-2005) in Vilna. She had attended school with his sister and they became reacquainted either in France where Raya studied for a year, or during one of his visits to family in Vilna. When Alexander returned to France, he and Raya carried on a courtship by mail. Alexander, an agricultural engineer, worked as a buyer of agriculture equipment for the Soviet government. Alexander and Raya married in Paris on February 11, 1937. Alexander worked as a translator and Raya as a secretary. Raya’s mother died a natural death in Vilna in 1939. On September 1,1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Alexander was recalled to the French military and stationed on the Maginot Line, a series of fortifications along the French-German border. Germany invaded France in May 1940 and, in June, France surrendered. Alexander was demobilized and went south to join Raya, who had fled to Toulouse. They applied for visas to emigrate to the United States. Alexander worked as a farm laborer and received lodging as part of his wages. In December 1940, he was told there was no work for the winter and found a job as an accountant in a shoe factory. The American aid agency, Joint Distribution Committee, had been dissolved and their prospects were very bleak. The couple’s first child, Alain, was born in Toulouse on June 13, 1941. The family received their US visas in 1942 and booked passage to America aboard the Portuguese ship, Carvalho Araujo. They sailed from Lisbon, Portugal, in late October and arrived in Baltimore, MD, on November 2, 1942. Raya’s father and sister had been confined in the Vilna ghetto following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Abram was killed that same year by the Germans during an action in Ponary, Lithuania. Katia survived the concentration camps of Kaiserwald and Stutthof and emigrated to the US in 1947. The couple had a daughter in the US. Alain, age 57, died in 1998 in France. Alexander, age 70, died in 1975 in New York. Raya, age 95, passed away on December 26, 2005, in Washington DC.
