119 folders and 158 registers

This fonds contains documents of the schools of Mantua that are part of the first Educational Circle: personal files of the teachers, personal files of the school workers, school registers, school reports and the like. This fonds is very useful for the reconstruction of the career of Jewish students or teachers before and after anti-Semitic laws (1938).
