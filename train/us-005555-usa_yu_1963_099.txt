Records of the Central Relief Committee, Volume II.

ca. 34 l.m.

In this fonds, we firstly note box 105 folder 1 (years 1920-1940), containing an account book which lists appropriations to yeshivot and Talmud Torahs in several European countries, including Belgium. The series of correspondence with Europe, the Far East and Palestine/Israel contains two files relevant to Belgium. Box 224 folder 15 contains questionnaires and lists concerning Belgium, Lithuania and Romania (1938-1939). In box 225 folder 4 we find correspondence and receipts with regards to Yeshiva Etz Hayim in Heide (Antwerp), for the year 1939. Lastly, we point out that the inventory description of the series of reports (ca. 1928-1949) mentions the Aide aux Isra√©lites Victimes de la Guerre, which was sponsored by the CRC after the Second World War. This series may therefore contain interesting information on the activities of the AIVG.
