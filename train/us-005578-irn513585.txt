Moishe, Symcha, and Haskel Kader left Poland around 1940 for Russia. They are the only survivors of their immediate family. Eda worked in Pionki labor camp and in 1944 was sent to Auschwitz for three to four months.

The collection consists of photographs depicting Symcha and Eda Kader (Harvey Kader's parents), Moishe and Lola Kader (Harvey Kader's uncle and aunt), and Anna and David Kader (Harvey Kader's twin cousins) in a refugee camp in Stuttgart, Germany, after World War II. Also included are two Rosh Hashana greeting cards bearing images of Anna and David Kader as infants.
