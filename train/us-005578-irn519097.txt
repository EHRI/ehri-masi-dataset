Consists of one photograph taken in the Gurs internment camp in May 1943. The photograph depicts two women, each holding a toddler, and is captioned "Wally, Heiner, Trude, und Suzy in Gurs." It is believed that "Trude" is Trude Frank, a cousin of Lore Rosen [donor] who survived the war and "disappeared" in East Germany shortly thereafter.
