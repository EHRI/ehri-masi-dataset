1,670 digital images, JPEG and PDF

Ostrava Group at Kingston Synagogue

This collection contains materials from 83 families throughout the world originating from Ostrava, including: family photographs, as well as images of pre-war Ostrava, including synagogues and businesses, personal papers such as birth, marriage, and death certificates, school records, newspaper clippings, business advertisements, letters, as well as memoirs, genealogy charts, and testimonies documenting pre-war Jewish life in Ostrava, as well as experiences during the war, and in the postwar period, in many cases to the present: including information and photographs of the survivor's families, trips to Ostrava, and commemoration of the Holocaust in Ostrava. Included is a series of correspondence of the Goldberg family to brothers Oskar, Moses (Max) and Norbert (Bubik, Bertie) who, after the occupation of Bohemia, made their way through Poland to the United Kingdom, and which provides a glimpse of the communication of a family divided by the Holocaust. While the brothers managed to escape and establish themselves abroad, their mother and sisters with children stayed behind in the occupied “Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia“. Their father lived with his parents in the town of Oświęcim (Auschwitz). They were all deported and murdered later.
