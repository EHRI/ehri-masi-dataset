Joseph Langland: Poems re Buchenwald

1 folder

This deposit was apparently made in response to a request by the Wiener Library for Holocaust poetry in 1986. The depositor and author, Joseph Langland, was a soldier in the U.S. Army stationed close to Buchenwald shortly after its liberation. He published two poems about Buchenwald in books that are no longer in print and one about Hiroshima.
