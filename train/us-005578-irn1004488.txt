Trial of Bernard Natan

Scenes from the 1939 fraud trial of Bernard Natan, who took over Pathe in 1929. Natan is shown in the dock trying to hide from the cameras, first with a newspaper over his head and then with his hands. Natan, a Romanian-born Jew who became a French citizen, was convicted of fraud and sent to prison. He was released in 1942 and sent to Auschwitz, where he died.
