Sigismund Salo Rund was a German diplomat in the early 1930s and also owned an oil refinery and extensive property. He paid the German authorities to let him emigrate to the United States along with his daughter, Ellen, and her family, in 1936. His son Werner emigrated to the United States from France in 1939, where he had married Edith Israelski. Sigismund Rund's wife, whom he had divorced in 1937, remained in Berlin and hid as an Aryan in southern Germany during the war.

Collection consists of documents, photocopies, and passports relating to the family of Sigismund Salo Rund, originally of Berlin, Germany.
