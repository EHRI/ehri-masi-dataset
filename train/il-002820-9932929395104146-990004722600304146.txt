2 electronic resource (6 page and 2 pages)

This file contains 2 documents, both are instructions of different (press) referents of the ministery of propaganda of the National Socialist Party regarding daily political questions. It says in the heading of the first document, that they should only be used for political essays, but not be printed word-for-word in any case. On top of the first pages of each document there are handwritten dates of 23.6.39 and 18.8.39 added with question marks, but within the texts there are no dates mentioned. The names of the press referents are hardly readable and some of the typewritten text is neither. The instructions are dealing with the Conflict of Gdansk and Chamberlain, for example, and mention other daily political questions, among others also regarding foreign relations, that are covered in the German, English, American, Slovakian, Polish and Austrian (East Marchian) Press.
