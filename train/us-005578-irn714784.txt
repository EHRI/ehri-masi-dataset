Hans Rosenbaum was born on 20 June 1904 in Bünde, Germany to Theodor Rosenbaum and Martha Rosenbaum (née Bornheim). The family co-operated a cigar box factory, Rodenberg & Rosenbaum, founded in 1874 in Bünde, that manufactured veneers and cigar boxes, in addition to fish boxes. The family immigrated to the United States aboard the SS Nieuw Amsterdam from Rotterdam, arriving in New York on 2 September 1938. Hans and his family became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1944 in Raleigh County, West Virginia, where they eventually settled.

The Rosenbaum family papers consist of identification documents, a business card, and announcements that document the experiences of Hans Rosenbaum [the donor’s uncle], his parents Theodor and Martha, and his brother Erich before, during, and after the Holocaust. Documents relating to Hans include a birth announcement, a driver’s license, and a German passport, both issued in 1927 and 1938, respectively, that bear his photos. Also included is a business card for Rodenberg & Rosenbaum, the cigar box factory that was co-operated by the family. In addition, documents chronicling their naturalization include Hans's original U.S. naturalization certificate conferred in Raleigh County, West Virginia, as of 18 May 1944. A newspaper clipping dated 23 December 1944 depicts Theodor, Martha, and Erich Rosenbaum as the first family of three to be naturalized in the same ceremony in Raleigh county.
