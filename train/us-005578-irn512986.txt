In the accompanying explanatory note, the author describes the deportation of her and her parents from their home in Bucovina in 1941, to a death camp in Transnistria, from which she was liberated in 1945, although her parents had died on the way to the camp. She expresses longing for her home which she has not seen since 1941.
