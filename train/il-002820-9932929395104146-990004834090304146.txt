1 electronic resource (29 pages)

The file contains reports regarding the Jews in Poland of to-day and the outlines of political and cultural life. In adition it includes a survey regarding the same topic, both were published in German and English by the Jewish Central Information Office. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). The Polish events in 1936 and 1937 have attracted attantion of Jews of all countries in view of the recent changes, observed in the political and economic life of Poland. The main branches of industry were closed to the Jewish worker, the anti-semitic credit policy of the banks, the ill-famed tax system directed against the Jews, the systematic organisation of boycott against Jewish employees both physical and intellectual, all that was shaking the foundation of Jewish life and the Jews are pushed into the economic ghetto. This has caused discussions regarding not only the legal position of Jews in Poland but also led to examine the question of an intensified emigration of Polish Jews. Therefore the Jewish Central Information Office made an objective servey of the political, economic, social and cultural position of Jews in Poland which was of a great interest during that time. The contents of the survey are: Jewish population, point of Law, political parties, distribution of the Jews, professional distribution, cooperativ movements, Jewish misery, Jewish emigration, Jewish schools, cultural life of the Jews and a conclusion.
