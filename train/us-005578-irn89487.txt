The Evreiskii Komitet Pomoshchi Zhertvam Voiny (EKOPO) (Jewish Committee for the Assistance to the War Victims) was established in Russia in 1914. This organization provided necessary assistance and relief to tens of thousands of Jewish families who were displaced by Russian Tsarist government from Lithuania and Belarus during WWI. After WWI, the organization (under the Polish name, the Krajowy Komitet Żydowski Pomocy Ofiarom Wojny) continued to provide assistance to the Jewish victims of war and pogroms in the Vilna area. The EKOPO also played major role in the reconstruction of the Jewish communities of this region by providing funding to the local relief organizations, cultural, and educational organizations (known also as the Jewish Committee for Aid and Reconstruction).

The collection consists of minutes of the meetings, financial reports, correspondence with various Polish government offices, Jewish charitable and relief organizations, Jewish libraries and cultural organizations during the years 1919-1939, and various documents relating to organization activities.
