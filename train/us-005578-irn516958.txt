Herman (Hersz) Flamholc was born on January 15, 1916, in Głowno, Poland, near Łódź. His father, Lipman Flamholc, was a farmer, and his mother, Zisia Rojza Reps Flamholc, took care of the children. Herman had three sisters, Cipa, Chawa and Hela, and two brothers, Salek Israel and Szimszon. Chawa and Hela were twins. Herman’s parents, his three sisters, and his youngest brother, Szimszon, moved to the ghetto in Warsaw, Poland, where they lived with the Melamed family. In 1929 Herman moved to Łódź and lived with his Uncle Cudek. In October 1939 Herman and his brother, Salek, fled Poland, and after a month of traveling, they arrived in Chett, Siberia, in the Soviet Union. In July 1941 they were transferred to Kara-Balta, Kyrgystan, Soviet Union. In Kara-Balta Herman met Dwora Talalayevskaya, daughter of Baruch and Lieba, from Kharkiv, Ukraine, in the Soviet Union. On June 20, 1944, they married, and on December 2, 1945, their son, Peter Pinchus Flamholc, was born. Dwora and Herman moved to Kharkiv in July 1945 and lived there for two years. In October 1947 they repatriated to Poland for three years. They went from Poland to Israel in 1950. They stayed in Israel for eight months before immigrating to Mälmo, Sweden. The reason for going to Sweden was that Herman had two uncles in Scandinavia, one in Demark and the other in Sweden. Both uncles left Poland before the First World War and were the only surviving relatives of Herman. Dwora Flamholc passed away in 2013.

The Herman and Dwora Flamholc papers consist of two photographs of Herman Flamholc, Dwora while he was a refugee in Kara-Balta, Kyrgystan; a postcard sent from Ewa Chawa Flamholc, Dwora's aunt, in the ghetto in Warsaw, Poland, to Salek Flamholc in Chett, Siberia; a certificate that Dwora attended a Jewish school in Charkov, Ukraine; and two certificates of repatriation from the Soviet Union to Poland for Dwora and Herman Flamholc.
