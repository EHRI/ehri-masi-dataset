The Fischgrund family letters consists of two letters, one each in German and English, written to Adolph Fischgrund of New York City in 1939. The letters, one written by a member of the family of Moritz Fischgrund of Bratislava and the other written by Otto Fischgrund of Br√ºnn (now Brno, Czech Republic), describe the plights of the families and ask Mr. Fischgrund, who may or may not be a relation, if he would consider sponsoring them for immigration or to give money to help them.
