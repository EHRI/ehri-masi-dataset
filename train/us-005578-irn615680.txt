I'm An American -- Charles Pergler

On June 1, 1940, Dr. Charles Pergler shared his thoughts about immigration with the Chairmen of the Board of Review for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Ralph Stewart, on the NBC radio broadcast. The gentlemen discussed Pergler’s duality of foreign birth and upbringing in America. Stewart describes emigration as “a stranger in the gates”. He urges Americans to have tolerance and patience for foreign-born citizens as they assimilate. He gives an example of close-knit immigrant communities who do not learn English and have no connection to American life except during election season. Dr. Pergler suggests real democracy may only exist in homogeneous societies. He goes on to condemn any special organization created in defense of the foreign born. He explains the union will only bring attention to cultural differences and cause segregation. Dr. Charles Pergler warns Americans to be vigilant in protecting their own rights because their own thoughts or characteristics could one day place them in a minority grouping. Dr. Charles Pergler (b. Karel Pergler) was born on March 6, 1882 in Liblin, Bohemia. He immigrated to Chicago in 1890 at eight years old. After he graduated high school, Pergler returned to Bohemia. He became involved in the Democratic Socialist and anti-Austrian movement in Prague. The young scholar returned to Chicago in 1903 to continue his education at Kent College of Law. After graduation in 1908, Pergler moved to Howard County, Iowa where he practiced law for a decade. The Czechoslovak Republic claimed independence in 1918 and appointed Charles Pergler as its first Ambassador to the United States.
