Collection of photographic prints documenting the Dachau concentration camp following liberation. Images include piles of corpses of outside the crematorium and uniforms and clothing that was disinfected prior to the liberation of the camp; images were taken by US Army soldier Richard Sheppard, who sent them home in a letter, wrapped in a piece of paper labeled "Photos of / Dachau / concentration camp / Read letter before / opening." Although the letter was destroyed, the paper wrapping is included as part of this collection.
