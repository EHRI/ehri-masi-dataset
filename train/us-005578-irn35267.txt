United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Contains two typescript first-hand accounts written by US Captain Jacob A. Goodheart, stationed aboard the USA Hospital Ship Algonquin, which was under the command of Major Howard A. Donald, MC. The accounts describe two separate events aboard the ship: January 16, 1945's arrival at Marseilles for the purpose of exchanging German prisoners of war with Allied prisoners of war, and beginning February 1, 1945, the ship's acceptance of displaced victims of Nazi persecution, virtually all concentration camp survivors, in need of medical assistance.
