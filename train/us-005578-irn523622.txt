folder

1

Consists of 27 photographs depicting Clifford Byrum, other United States soldiers, and German prisoners exhuming infants' graves at a Volkswagen maternity hospital and Kinderheim (children's home) in Rühen, Germany, during the investigation of Nazi atrocities. A maternity hospital and Kinderheim was established by the Volkswagen corporation in Rühen, Germany, in March 1943 for children born to Polish and Russian forced laborers working at the VW factory in Wolfsburg. Because of unsanitary conditions and neglect at the Kinderheim, approximately 365 children under the age of 16 months died there between April 1943 and April 1945.
