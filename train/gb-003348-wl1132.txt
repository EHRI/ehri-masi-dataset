The Hebrew Committee of National Liberation was launched in May 1944. Its origins were in the Emergency Committee to save the Jewish People of Europe, which itself had been formed at an Emergency Conference in July 1943. The founder (and author of this letter) was Hillel Kook aka Peter Bergson. The new committee's aims were to continue to agitate for the rescue of Jews in Europe and to struggle against the British in Palestine. It aspired to be something of an alternative to the Jewish Agency.

Copy letter from Hillel Kook aka Peter Bergson, chairman of the Hebrew Committee of National Liberation, to Chaim Weizmann, President of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, in which he explains in some detail his ideas for the settlement of Palestine.<br />English 23 pages&nbsp;
