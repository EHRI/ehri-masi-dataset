Julian Epstein (born Jüdel, 1889-1943) was born on May 1, 1889 to Joseph and Esther Epstein in Minsk, then part of Russia. His wife, Margarete (neé Pick, 1898-1988) was born in Vienna, Austria, on August 30, 1898 to Gisela (neé Fisher) and Ignar Pick. Julian and Margarete married on March 28, 1920 in Vienna. Their daughter Monique Goss (neé Epstein 1941- ) was born on April 29, 1941 in Toulouse, France. Prior to World War II, Julian worked as an opera singer and a jeweler in Vienna. In April 1938, a month after the German annexation of Austria, Margarete and Julian fled to Chelles, France. In 1940, Julian was forced to join the French Foreign Legion and the family moved to Toulouse. In 1942, Julian was arrested and imprisoned at the internment camp Récébédou in southwest France. Likely transported to the internment camp Noé due to the closure of Récébédou on October 5, 1942, Julian was held at Noé from October 1, 1942 to February 20, 1943. By February 24, 1943, Julian had been transported to the Gurs internment camp. On March 4, 1943, Julian arrived at the Drancy transit camp near Paris with 100 francs, two watches, and a pen. Two days later, on March 6, 1943, Julian was deported from Drancy to the Lublin-Majdanek concentration camp in Poland on transport 51, where he died. During the war, Margarete Epstein hid her young daughter in Carbonne, France. Though they hid separately throughout the war, both survived.
