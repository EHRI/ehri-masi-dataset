Four clips from propaganda film about the 1934 Reich Party Day

01:02:22 to 01:02:47 Opening sequences from Triumph of the Will, panning down from the Nazi eagle and swastika down to the title of the film. 01:02:50 to 01:03:03 An enthusiastic crowds greets Hitler with cheers and salutes as he arrives in Nuremberg by plane on September 5, 1934 for the sixth Reich Party Day. 01:03:06 to 01:03:23 A smiling woman holding a young girl hands Hitler flowers as he rides down the street in an open car in Nuremberg. Cheering crowds line the street. CU on smiling young girls and a panning shot of young children leaning forward trying to see Hitler. 01:03:26 to 01:03:54 More shots of wildly enthusiastic crowds with a soundtrack of cheers and "Heils." Hitler appears at a window, presumably the window of the Hotel Deutscher Hof, which he is seen entering moments before in the film (not included in this clip) to wave to the crowds. Underneath the window "Heil Hitler" is spelled out in light bulbs.
