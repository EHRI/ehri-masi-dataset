Leo Bach (born Leo Silberhach) was born in Krakow, Poland on May 21, 1927 to Jacob and Gitla Silberbach. He had two siblings, Hana Silberbach (Anna, b. circa 1925) and Karl Silberbach (b. circa 1929). In March 1941, the Silberbach family moved to Mogila to escape moving into the Krakow ghetto. In August 1942, several members were deported from Wieliczka to a death camp where they perished. Leo Bach was sent to the Krawkow ghetto, and then sent as a forced laborer to the airfields. In July 1943, he was deported to the Płaszów concentration camp. In November 1943 he was sent to Starachowice. In July 1944, the prisoners of Starachowice were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, then sent on a death march to Buchenwald concentration camp. He was liberated from Dachau concentration camp in April 1945. He was eventually reunited with his father who also survived the Holocaust. Leo immigrated to the United States in January 1948 at the age of 20.

The Leo Bach collection consists of an untitled memoir (326 pages) and copies of photographs related to the Holocaust experiences of Leo Bach (born Leo Silberbach), originally of Krakow, Poland. In his memoir, Leo Bach gives extensive descriptions of the history of Poland, his family, his memories of pre-war antisemitism, and the German invasion of Poland. He describes life under the German occupation, his experiences in the Krakow ghetto, Płaszów concentration camp, Starachowice, Auschwitz concentration camp, a death march to Buchenwald concentration, and his liberation from Dachau concentration camp. Though members of his family were deported from Wieliczka to a death camp where they perished, Bach was eventually reunited with his father, who also survived the Holocaust.
