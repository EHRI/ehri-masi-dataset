Nazi propaganda: leadership principle

The compilation starts with a staged scene of an uniformed Nazi officer speaking in Russian about the Fuehrer to people with beards and shabby clothing gathering in a hut. Then documentary footage of Hitler is shown: in a car passing cheering masses, addressing a gathering about overcoming of any pre-existing cleavages in favor of the unity of the German people, at the balcony of the Reichskanzlei [Reich chancellery] watching a torch-lit parade in 1933 to the sound of the German national anthem, with Baldur von Schirach and Rudolf Hess at a stadium gathering of the Hitler Youth, at the Olympic Games in Berlin 1936 in the stadium, with Count Ciano at the mountain retreat of the Obersalzburg, visiting the Krupp factories in Essen, at the Sportpalast Berlin giving a speech beside a banner reading "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuehrer" [One people, One empire, One leader], visiting an exhibition of 'German' art together with Himmler, with children handing him flowers, leaving a plane at the airport Berlin-Tempelhof. Further scenes show the Brandenburg Gate and the Siegess√§ule [Pillar of Victory] in Berlin, streets decorated with Nazi flags, a stretch of the Autobahn, appearances of Goebbels and Goering. This film seems to be intended to increase support and adoration for Hitler and the German people in Slav populations. It is a genuine German compilation of footage with added staged scenes in the beginning and Russian sound.
