folder

1

Consists of an enlarged commemorative photograph of Schwarzburg, Germany, in the shape of a heart, as part of the materials from the post-war experiences of the Kozler family, originally of Kryłów, Poland. The Kozlers, a Catholic Polish family, were separated when Stanislaw was sent into Germany for forced labor. The rest of the family was later sent to a forced labor camp near Schwarzburg and reunited with Stanislaw right before being liberated by the American military. The family lived at a displaced persons camp near Coburg until 1949, when they immigrated to the United States.
