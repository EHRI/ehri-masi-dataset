All three survived the initial selection. Mrs. Low describes living and working conditions, her memory of music in the camp, and her memories of the hanging of Roza Robota and the other women who smuggled powder for the attempted Sonderkommando uprising. She describes the death march to Ravensbrück and from there, her transport to Mecklenburg, and her liberation by the American Army with her daughter.
