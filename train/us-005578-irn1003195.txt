Hitler reviews SA

Title - "Fascists Hail Hitler - Thousands of Nationalists Opposing Compromises by Government are Reviewed by Leader in Thuringia." Crowds line a street as an SA band marches past (Steinitz department store (?) appears in the background). Scene of Hitler reviewing the parade, with Rudolf Hess behind him and Wilhelm Frick in civilian clothing in front of Hitler. The camera pans up to show people leaning out of windows (of a hotel?). Scene switches to Hitler in a car riding through the street - he stands and salutes the crowds lining the street.
