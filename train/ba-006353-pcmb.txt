Collection of photographs and documents

2 boxes

The Museum owns  a collection of mostly photographs that depicts old synagogue, Jewish cemetery in BihaÄ‡, Jewish stores before the Second World War, etc. 
While basic, it might still be valuable for research into local Jewish community and Holocaust.
