Consists of one memoir, 16 pages, entitled "Dinnertime Survivor Tale," by Harvy Simkovits, originally of Kassa (Kosice). In the memoir, Mr. Simkovits describes his mother describing her Holocaust experiences over dinner and how she survived the war as a Slovak-Hungarian Jew. In 1944, when Germany invaded Hungary, the family moved from Kassa to Budapest, using false papers and posing as non-Jews. She described learning of the deportation of the Jews of Kassa, who were sent to Auschwitz in May 1944. She also described life in Budapest at the end of the war and returning to Kassa (Kosice).
