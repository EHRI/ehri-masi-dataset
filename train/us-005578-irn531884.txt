Tibor and Margit were married on May 10, 1936 in Miskolc, Hungary. In 1942 Tibor was drafted into special labor service units. In 1944 Margit and her two small daughters escaped from Miskolc to Budapest, avoiding deportation to Auschwitz. They survived in hiding until liberation in January 1945. Tibor, who was moved to the Eastern front was captured by the Soviet Army and imprisoned as a POW, despite his being a victim of persecution in Hungary. He was finally released in July 1948. He joined his family in Miskolc, and in 1957 the Family left Hungary for the UK. They immigrated to the United States in 1966.
