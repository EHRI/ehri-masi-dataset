Dreyfuss-Isenberg family. Collection

38 digitised images (11 documents and 7 photo)

The collection contains seven photos of the Dreyfuss-Isenberg family and a prayer card commemorating rescuer Yvonne Veys as well as seven letters and two cards. Five letters and perhaps the two cards were sent by the Dreyfuss family, after they had moved to Leuven, to their former next-door neighbours, the Perck family. Two other letters were sent by the Dreyfuss family, while detained at the Dossin barracks, to their friends the Perck family and the Samuel family.
