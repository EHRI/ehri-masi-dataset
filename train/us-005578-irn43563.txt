Consists of one memoir, 4 pages, written by John J. Rothschild, originally of Zurich, Switzerland. In his memoir, Mr. Rothschild, who moved to France in 1934, describes meeting his future wife, Renée, who was originally from Germany. After the German invasion of France, he and Renée were separated and he returned to Switzerland in 1941. His family was deported from France to Auschwitz in July 1942 where they perished. Renée was imprisoned in Rivesaltes and was on a list to be deported east in October 1942 when Mr. Rothschild was able to intervene. Together they escaped back to Switzerland and married in December 1942, the only survivors of their families.
