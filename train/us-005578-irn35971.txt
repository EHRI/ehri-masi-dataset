1

Consists of one memoir, 20 pages, entitled "The Holocaust Years", written by Morris Gliklich, originally of Nisko, Poland. In the memoir, Mr. Gliklich describes pre-war life in Nisko, the German invasion of Poland, anti-Jewish legislation, and their escape into Russian territory. While in Russian territory, the family was reunited with Mr. Gliklich's father, whom they had believed to have been killed during the German invasion. The family was forced onto a train headed east and arrived in Siberia, where they lived in the areas of Synia and Kirinsk until 1943. The family slowly made their way south, but after they were told they needed Soviet citizenship, they decided to return to Poland in 1945. The family managed to sneak into the American sector of Germany and lived in a displaced persons camp. Mr. Gliklich immigrated to the United States in May 1951.
