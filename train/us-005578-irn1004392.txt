Commemoration of the death of Milan Stefanik

A ceremony commemorates the death of Slovak general Milan Stefanik, who was an instrumental figure in the cause of Czechoslovak sovereignty. Crowds gathered on a hilltop near a memorial tomb for Stefanik. Shot of soldiers standing watch at the memorial, looking down at the crowd. A minster speaks to the crowd as soldiers stand at attention. CUs of officers and civilians. Shots of women in traditional dress as planes fly overhead. Portrait of Stefanik fades to reveal shot of the memorial tomb.
