Collection of Ethnics and History of Medicine

The collection consists of more than 600 items.

Initiated by Hans Fleischhacker in 1943, the collection mainly consists of more than 600 hand-, foot-, and finger-prints of mostly Jewish inmates of the Lódź Ghetto (Litzmannstadt Ghetto) in Poland. Strongly influenced by racial biology, it was the antropologists aim to use this collection for attesting the supposed morphological differences between the palms of Jews and non-Jews.
It is the only collection of this kind, and testimony to the terrifying abuse of scientific methods under the National Socialists.
