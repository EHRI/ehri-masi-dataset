Germans building the WWII defensive line; Hitler tours the Siegfried Line

Reel 2, German laborers working on the Siegfried Line stop for lunch. Concrete ""dragon's teeth"" antitank obstacles, barbed wire entanglements and blockhouses along the Rhine River, an observation tower, and farmers working in a field nearby. A diagram shows the interlocking field of fire from points of the Siegfried Line. German troops march and enter a tunnel into fortifications. Hitler tours the area.
