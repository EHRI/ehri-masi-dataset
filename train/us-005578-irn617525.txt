French propaganda film

This French film of 1943 was commissioned by Nazi Germany's propaganda ministry within occupied France. It is notable as the last film to be directed by Paul Riche (pseudonym of Jean Mamy), an ex-Mason. The film virulently denounces Freemasonry, parliamentarianism, and Jews as part of Vichy's drive agains them and seeks to prove a Jewish-Masonic plot. On France's liberation, the film's writer, producer, and director were purged for collaborating with the Nazis. This very short excerpt (39 seconds) contains the opening title sequence and a newspaper headline regarding President Roosevelt.
