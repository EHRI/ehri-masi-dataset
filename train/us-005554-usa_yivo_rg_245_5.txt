This fonds contains many files concerning the situation of Jewish refugees in Belgium before the Second World War, and the work of BELHICEM/BEL-HIAS in particular. First of all, the records of a general nature in Series I (“France I, Pre-Occupation Records, 1933-1940”) may hold valuable information on Belgium – see the many general files, minutes of meetings, activity reports, statistical material and correspondence, often arranged by country. For instance, we can find information on the establishment of HICEM offices in Belgium (1939) in the minutes of monthly meetings of the HICEM Paris office (file France I-1). Topics such as the situation of refugees in Belgium, the offices and work of BELHICEM in Brussels, cooperation with BELHICEM, … are explicitly mentioned in the following files: France I-69 (“Correspondence with the Magyar Izraelita Partfogo Irodaja”, 1940), France I-116 (“Correspondence with HICEM Latvia”, 1940), France I-134 (“Correspondence with Odborza Pomoc (Society for Assistance) and the German-Jewish Assistance Committee”, 1940), France I-177 (“Correspondence with Charles Barlas, of the Jewish Agency for Palestine (Geneva)”, 1940), France I-343 (“Correspondence with Helsinki, the UK and Palestine”, 1940), France I-350 (“Correspondence of the Marseilles office and various aid organisations in Italy, Poland, Belgium, Portugal and France”, 1938-1940) and France I-424 (“Receipts and correspondence [regarding refugee expenses] among HICEM (Paris) and affiliates in Belgium, Switzerland and Latvia”, 1940). The aforementioned Series I contains a Subseries 2 (“BELHICEM and other organisations in Belgium”, 1938-1940), consisting exclusively of material (40 folders in total) with regards to the Belgian HICEM section and various Belgian refugee committees. Firstly, we note a series of general reports of BELHICEM (ca. 1939-1940) – see France I-431, France I-432, France I-433, France I-434 and France I-457. They often contain annexes, such as statistical material, lists of refugees, budgets, etc. Summary financial reports for the year 1940 can be found in France I-460; for weekly financial reports (of 1940), see France I-459. The following files consist of circulars and correspondence (1939-1940) with BELHICEM (on general and financial matters, administrative correspondence, refugee legislation, transportation, …): France I-435, France I-436, France I-437, France I-438, France I-439, France I-440, France I-442, France I-443, France I-444 and France I-458.

Lastly, we find miscellaneous documents (operating budget, statements) from BELHICEM in file France I-441. The series also contains material on other Belgian refugee organisations. For correspondence between the Comité d’Assistance aux Réfugiés juifs (CARJ) in Brussels and various aid organisations (1939-1940), see France I-452. Correspondence between the CARJ and HICEM Paris (on administrative matters and regarding arrangements for refugees) can be found in France I-462, France I-463, France I-464 and France I-465. France I-456 contains a list of refugees wishing to go to Argentina, addressed to the same organisation. Monthly and annual reports (1939-1940) of the CARJ including lists of refugees can be found in France I-461. In France I-468, France I-469 and France I-470 we find correspondence concerning arrangements for refugees between Esra (in Antwerp) and HICEM Paris (1939-1940). France I-466 and France I-467 contain resp. monthly (1940) and annual (1939) activity reports of Esra. Finally, we note the following miscellaneous files: administrative correspondence, mainly with the Association belge pour l’Émigration des Réfugiés from Brussels (France I-453; 1940); “correspondence among various aid organisations on behalf of named refugees” (France I-454; 1939-1940) and administrative correspondence with Esra Luxembourg (France I-455; 1939-1940). Series IV (“France IV, Post-war records of HICEM/HIAS, 1939-1953”) also holds relevant files regarding the work of the Belgian branch of HICEM/HIAS, or concerning refugees and survivors in Belgium.
