His father worked as a merchant in Paris, and the family lived in an apartment in the XVIII arrondissement.

The family was arrested during a raid in late 1941, but a neighbor, Mme. Caron, sought out the family and sought the release of Pierre and his sister, Eddy. Mme. Caron managed to hide the children durnig the remainder of the German occupation, but their parents were deported to Auschwitz, where they perished.
