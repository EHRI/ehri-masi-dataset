Anna Friedman Prager was born as Chana Sima Frydman on January 6, 1936, in Chmielnik, Poland, to Icek and Tema Frydman. In June 1940 the Soviets expelled Tema, Icek, and Anna Frydman to Bodaybo (Bodaibo), a forced labor camp in Siberia. They were released in 1943 and migrated to Samarkand (Samarqand) in Uzbekistan. In 1945 the Frydmans immigrated illegally to Sweden and settled in Landskrona where they remained until 1949.
