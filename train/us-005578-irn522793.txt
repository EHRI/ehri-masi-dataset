The Nazi propaganda flier was acquired by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2005.

Flier distributed by the Nazi Party following the Reichstag fire on February 27, 1933, as part of their propaganda efforts to expand Hitler's powers as Chancellor of Germany. The fire was blamed on the Communists and the regime was given the authority to jail political opponents without charges and to suspend civil liberties, such as freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Many Germans became convinced that Hitler had saved the nation from a Bolshevik revolution.
