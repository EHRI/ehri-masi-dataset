Československá vládní komise pro stíhání nacistických válečných zločinců

49 linear metres of documents which are not processed and inventoried, however the fonds is accessible.

After the commission cancellation, part of the documents and files was lost and about 250 boxes of documents were transferred to the State Central Archives (today the National Archives).

The creator of this fonds, the Czechoslovak Government Commission for Prosecution of Nazi War Criminals was created to search and try war criminals who committed crimes on the Czechoslovak territory during the WWII. During its existence when led by Bohumil Ečer (later by Bohuslav Kučera), the commission investigated about 700 possible war criminals and worked out about 90 cases with extradition requests. The commission was cancelled in 1990.

The fonds contains records, information and mailing of the commission, records of the commission meetings, administration files, documents copies, above all Nazi criminals extradition requests, documents about Nazi judges, war criminal lists etc.
