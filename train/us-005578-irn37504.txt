Maximilian Goldstein (1880-1941) was a renowned researcher, historian and collector of Jewish art in Lwów (Lemberg, Lvov, Lviv). His large private collection included old Jewish books, paintings, furniture and other Jewish artifacts. The collection became a foundation for a private Jewish Museum established in Goldstein’s house in Lwów before WWII. After the Soviet occupation in 1939 the collection was transferred to the Museum of Arts and Industry, where Goldstein was hired as a staff member. With the beginning of the Nazi occupation of Lwów Maximilian Goldstein was imprisoned in the Lwów ghetto where he died sometime in 1941.
