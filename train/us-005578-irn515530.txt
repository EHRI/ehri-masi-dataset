Samuel Stimler was born in 1923, in a town 70-80 miles east of Kraków, Poland. After the Nazi invasion, he spent time in a ghetto and in a few small labor camps. Samuel Stimler spent time in Pustkow, Plaszów, Gross Rosen, and Brünnlitz before being liberated by the Russians in 1945. After liberation, he traveled to Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Foehrenwald, a displaced persons camp in Germany, before journeying to Antwerp, Belgium, and eventually emigrating to the United States.

The papers consist of a pre-printed form with Oskar Schindler letterhead from Oskar Schindler's factory in Kraków, Poland, and a letter stating that Samuel Stimler was in Brünnlitz concentration camp in Brnenec, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic).
