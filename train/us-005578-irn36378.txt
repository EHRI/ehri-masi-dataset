Consists of one memoir entitled "Chapters of Remembrance: The Memoirs of Michal Lubliner, Volume I, 1905-1945," translated from the original Yiddish into English by Dr. Jacob (Coby) Lubliner, the author's son. In the memoir, Mr. Lubliner describes his childhood in Maleniec, Poland, religious figures he knew, Hasidic life, and the outbreak of World War I. The family escaped to Piotrków to join family, and after the war, he moved to Berlin to attend university. He married in Łódź in 1933 and had a son, Yaakov (Jacob or Coby) in 1935. He describes the German invasion in 1939 and, instead of moving into the Łódź ghetto, he took his family to the Piotrków ghetto to be with the extended family. He describes his memories of, and the deaths of, various family members, and life in forced labor in Piotrków. In November 1944, he and his son were sent to Buchenwald, while his wife was sent to Ravensbrück and Bergen-Belsen. In Buchenwald, he was separated from his son and sent to Berga, and from there, on a death march from which he was liberated by the Soviet Army on May 9, 1945. He reunited with his wife and son in Bergen-Belsen in June 1945.
