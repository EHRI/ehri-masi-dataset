Rose Zar (Szoszana Zarnowiecki or Rose Guterman) was born on July 27, 1923 in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland. After the German invasion, Rose lived in the Piotrków ghetto until April 1940 when she fled to Warsaw where she obtained false identification papers under the name of Wanda Gajda. In December 1942 she moved to Kraków where she worked as a nanny in the home of Kurt Albers, a German SS officer. After the end of World War II, she married a fellow survivor, Mayer Zarnowiecki (Zar), who was interned in Buchenwald and Theresienstadt after leaving the Piotrków ghetto. As displaced persons, the couple worked together at the Lindenfels children's home in Germany where they helped prepare Jewish children for emigration to Palestine.

Consists of a photograph album assembled by the donor’s parents, Rose and Mayer Zar, documenting their activities with “Hashomer Hatzair” youth in the Lindenfels displaced persons camp and 73 photographic portraits that Jewish child survivors presented as a parting memento to Rose and Mayer Zar. Most of the children survived in hiding during the Holocaust. Rose and Mayer Zar prepared the children for emigration to Palestine.
