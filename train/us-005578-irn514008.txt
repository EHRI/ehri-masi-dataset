The papers consist largely of 11 photographs depicting a concentration camp (probably Buchenwald) at the time of liberation and various anonymous members of the German military. There is also an obituary for Franz Suchy who died on December 21, 1942, in the Battle of Ploskaja, as well as an employment identification card from the German railroad for Heinrich Suchy.
