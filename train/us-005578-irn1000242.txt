Brief: animap of Hungary-Czechoslovakia region. VAR standard shots of the German military entering Czechoslovakia: soldiers ride bicycles, tanks, and motorcycles on the snowy roads. Military enters the cities of Jihlava and Německý Brod. and completely fill the squares with military vehicles. Soldiers and police (in long coats) stand around, eating, conversing. "PRAHA" sign. Swarms of people wave as vehicles drive down wet streets and then enter gated square. Snow falling and blowing. Crowds swarm to see Hitler, who is driven into the square. Wearing a long coat, he walks in the square amid Nazi military personnel, all very serious. The masses of people are cheering wildly. VAR shots: bandaged soldiers at attention, admiring women, Hitler shaking hands with civilian women; crowds gesture "Sieg Heil"; large, emblemized swastika; "Adolph Hitler Platz" sign going up. Parade of Hitler Youth, National Anthem, flags being raised, crowds in parade stands wave swastika flags, etc. Hitler with entourage. Views of the crowd-crammed streets make it clear this is a massive parade, leading up to quick shot of Hitler at outdoor podium, and view of large swastika flag display. [SOUND: roar of crowd, some VO, fanfare dramatic music.] German soldiers on horseback march through checkpoint into small town, followed by military motorcade. All are smilingly received by large crowd of townspeople, including "sieg heils", flowers being tossed, children waving swastika flags. Women in window. Good shots.
