Germans dig defensive trench

Hitler Youth on bicycles riding down a road. Shirtless boys with shovels jump into a trench and start digging enthusiastically. Civilians, including women, also dig. The narration says that members of Hitler Youth (HJ), Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD) and civilians are helping to dig anti-tank trenches at the Eastern front. An old man smoking a pipe wipes his brow. Views shot from the window of a low-flying plane show the extent and zigzag pattern of the trench.
