In 1947 it changed its name to the <em>Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes</em> to include all those who suffered under the Nazis. This anti-fascist organisation still exists with branches all over Germany. Hans Schwarz was born in Vienna in 1904. He had already been imprisoned well before 1933 along with Bruno Kreisky and other Austrian Marxists. He was a political prisoner in Dachau from 1934-1944 and from October 1944 to April 1945 in Neuengamme. A committed opponent of the Nazis, he was a member of illegal prisoner organisations in both concentration camps. Paul Anderson (previously Harald MÃ¼ller) was born in Hamburg in 1908. He came to London in 1934 and worked as a political commentator for the BBC. Between 1945 and 1947 he was Paris correspondent for <em>The Observer.</em> He died in London on 9 March 1972.</p>
