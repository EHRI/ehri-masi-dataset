Correspondence with Bloemendahl, Alice

8 letters

Alice Bloemendahl (1874-1959) was a Jewish-German teacher and Holocaust survivor. Deported to the Terezin ghetto in 1942, she was part of an exchange transport of 1200 inmates that were brought to Switzerland in February 1945. She returned to Hamburg after the end of the war.

Containing letters by The Wiener Library exclusively, the correspondence centres on two eyewitness accounts on her experiences in the Theresienstadt Ghetto Bloemendahl provided the Library with. Options of her further involvement in the eyewitness testimony project are also discussed.
