I'm An American -- Xavier Cugat

On March 30, 1941 Xavier Cugat spoke with William H. Marshall, Assistant District Director of Immigration at Ellis Island about his life in America as a musician. Cugat shares his immigration story with Mr. Marshall. He reveals that all schools in South America teach English and thinks America should follow suit with the Spanish language. Cugat shares his belief in the benefits of being able to speak multiple languages. The musician talks about the popularization of Latin American music in America and rumors of the genre overpowering American jazz. “The Rumba King” closes the segment by stating naturalization is more serious than choosing a wife. Xavier Cugat (b. Francisco de Asís Javier Cugat Mingall de Bru y Deulofeu) was born on January 1, 1900 in Girona, Catalonia, Spain. His family immigrated to Havana, Cuba when he was 3. Always musically inclined, Cugat trained as a classical violinist, eventually earning a spot in the Orchestra of the Teatro Nacional. In 1915, he and his family moved to New York City on board the SS Havana. Cugat entered the world of show business playing with a band called the Gigolos during the tango craze. After a few years of playing at smaller clubs in the New York and Los Angeles area, Cugat and his band secured a job at the prestigious Coconut Grove nightclub in 1928. The Spaniard's style of music was so popular that he was nicknamed the “The Rumba King” in the 1930s and 1940s. Cugat was instrumental in bringing Latin music to the attention of the American public.
