3

Max Katz was born in Schotten, Germany to Nathan (1878-1942?) and Selma Katz (née Stern, 1884-1942?). He had one sister, Pauline (1917-1942?). Max immigrated to the United States before the start of World War II and settled in Hoboken, New Jersey. Max worked to secure funding and visas for his family’s emigration from Germany, but was unable to help them. His parents and sister were likely deported to the Minsk ghetto in September 1942 where they perished.

Consists of three folders of correspondence between Max Katz of Chicago, Ill., and his cousin, Max Katz of Hoboken, N.J. The letters relate to the attempts of Max Katz (Hoboken, N.J.) to collect funds to finance the emigration of Nathan, Selma, and Pauline Katz from Germany to the United States. In some cases, the letters contain detailed genealogical information about the Katz family in Germany and the United States. The letters in German are usually followed by an English translation.
