Contains a handwritten diary by Frieda (née Schwarzschild, 1887–1942) and Marcus (Max, 1878–1942) Reinach. Frieda and Max Reinach kept a diary in Berlin from September 1, 1939 to October 24, 1942. On October 26, 1942, they were deported to Riga, and later Kaiserwald concentration camp where they were murdered. The diary describes their life under the Nazi occupation. The collection also includes an English translation, a short history of how the diary reached the United States, and three photographs of the Reinach family members: Ilana Schwartz with her mother, Ilana Schwartz with her father and the grave site of Ilana's mother's aunt, Berta. Berta, who had childhood polio and was wheelchair bound, was the only Holocaust survivor of the Reinach family. Berta had been the subject of medical experimentation during the war.
