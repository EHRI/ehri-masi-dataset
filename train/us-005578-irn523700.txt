Wilfred "Bill" Kay (also known as Szlomo Katz, 1928 or 1930-2016) was born Szlomo Katz in Pu≈Çtusk, Poland. When WW II broke out, he and his parents and six siblings fled their home. His entire family perished in the Holocaust. Wilfred survived, spent several years in a displaced persons camp, and immigrated to the United States in 1949.

Papers consist of six birth certificates that were reissued for Wilfred Kay's siblings: Szulem Iser Sholom Katz, Szymon [Shimon] Kac, Sima Kac, Ester-Leja [Lea] Kac, Ruchla [Rachel] Kac, and Benjamin Kac. All six perished in the Holocaust.
