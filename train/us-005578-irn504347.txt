Letter describing John R. Kellam's experiences in 1945 with Gerhardt Gutzat, a German prisoner-of-war, held in Milan, Michigan, who did not believe American press accounts which stated that the Nazis had tried to exterminate the Jews of Europe and that Nazi concentration camps had killed thousands of people.
