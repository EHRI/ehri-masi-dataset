The German Emigrants Card Catalog expatriated by the Nazis (Ausb√ºrgerungskartei)

36 Files

The Nazi regime in Germany revoked the citizenship of German citizens who emigrated from Germany, and criticized the regime. Revocation of citizenship also meant confiscation of property, an action which turned many of the emigrants (who had escaped from Germany without managing to sell their property) into people with nothing at all. The lists of those whose citizenship had been revoked were published in the"Deutscher Reichsanzeiger", the official State publication. The first list was published on 25 August 1933, and the last list on 17 April 1945. All together the lists contained the names of 39,006 people, who represented most of the intellectual and cultural German elite before the Nazi rise to power.

In the Collection there is a card catalog of German emigrants whose citizenship was revoked due to their emigration from Germany; these former citizens are regarded as enemies of the regime. Included in the card catalog are the names of many Jews as well as leftists, including artists, authors and journalists.
