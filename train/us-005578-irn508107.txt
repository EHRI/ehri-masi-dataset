Sarah Froiman (1915-1943) was born in Poland. During the Holocaust, she was confined to the Mińsk Mazowiecki ghetto and forced to perform slave labor at the Rudzki factory. She had planned to join her brother Isadore in hiding with Marianna Gut (later named Righteous Among the Nations) on June 7, 1943, but she was shot to death along with her sister Etel (17 years old), brother Mordechai (12 years old), and the other workers when the factory was liquidated on June 5, 1943.

Sarah Froiman, a Polish Jewish woman who was imprisoned by the Nazis during the Holocaust, wrote this letter shortly before being killed when the Germans shot to death all of the Jewish slave laborers from the Rudzki factory in Mińsk Mazowiecki. She describes hiding among Christians, the horror of her situation, and her fear that she would soon be killed, and she begs for help.
