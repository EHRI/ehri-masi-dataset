The papers consist of a manuscript and photographs relating to the experiences of Abraham-Avrum Sperber and his family before, during, and after World War II. The hand-written manuscript was purportedly transcribed after World War II in a composition notebook from original notes kept by Abraham-Avrum Sperber while living under Nazi-occupation in Kolomyi︠a︡, Poland (now Ukraine). He describes events that occured between March 3, 1941, and July 7, 1942. The photographs depict the pre- and post-World War II life of Sperber and his family in Ukraine, Romania, and Israel.
