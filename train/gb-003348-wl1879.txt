1 folder

Edmund Hamber was born in Vienna in 1893. He and his elder brother, Philipp, worked in the Social Democratic Viennese film scene during the pre-nazi era. They were producers, distributors and owners and creators of a cinema chain. After the advent of the nazis it became increasingly difficult for Jews to work in the film industry. They were both arrested by the nazis and sent to Dachau in 1938 and thereafter to Buchenwald on 26.12.1939 where Philipp's brutal murder was witnessed by his brother and several others. Three weeks later, after Edmund had lodged an official complaint about his brother's treatment, he too was murdered on 28.11.1940. Edmund married Marie Hunatschek (born 1891) who was deported and killed at Maly Trostinec on 31.8.1942. They had three daughters who all managed to escape to Great Britain: Margaret (born 1921), Liselotte (born 1922), Gertrude (born 1927)&nbsp;
