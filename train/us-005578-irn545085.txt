The beer stein was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2016 by the Katz Family.

The Katz Ehrenthal Collection is a collection of more than 900 objects depicting Jews and antisemitic and anti-Jewish propaganda from the medieval to the modern era, in Europe, Russia, and the United States. The collection was amassed by Peter Ehrenthal, a Romanian Holocaust survivor, to document the pervasive history of anti-Jewish hatred in Western art, politics and popular culture. It includes crude folk art as well as pieces created by Europe's finest craftsmen, prints and periodical illustrations, posters, paintings, decorative art, and toys and everyday household items decorated with depictions of stereotypical Jewish figures.

Peter Dümler was born on November 7, 1860, in Höhr, Prussia, which became Höhr-Grenzhausen, Germany. Peter married Bertha Breiden. The couple had five children, including a son, Paul. They lived in a double house with Bertha’s brother and Peter’s childhood friend, Albert Breiden (1860-1926). Peter and Albert became potters and were trained by Simon Peter Gerz (1830-1893), Albert’s uncle. Peter was also trained by Reinhold Hanke (1839-1886). In approximately 1883, Peter and Albert formed a ceramics manufacturing company, Dümler and Breiden. Peter was the designer and modeler and Albert ran the factory. They initially made practical crockery and won first place prizes in exhibits in Antwerp and Koblenz in 1885. In about 1890, they began producing steins. Peter, age 46, died on April 19, 1907, in Germany.

Blue, brown, and black ceramic beer stein with antisemitic scenes depicting Jews being expelled from Germany and back to their kosher nation. Steins with anti-Jewish images were very popular in late 19th century Germany. The constitution of the newly unified Germany, adopted in 1871, emancipated all Jews. The following decades saw a surge in anti-semitism. It was more vicious and openly expressed, and became a popular cause for several political parties. This beer stein is one of more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of antisemitic visual materials.
