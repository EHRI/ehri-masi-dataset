The Hungarian News Agency circulated a huge amount of diverse materials in the inter-war period and the years of the Second World War. They were still called lithographs though they actually consisted of stencil materials by this time. For the Hungarian papers, the Hungarian News Agency sent daily, weekly and confidential reports, economic editions and related dispatches. It circulated separately prepared news for foreign consumption. It also had internal handouts and so called unpublished communiqués. With the sole exception of the confidential reports, all of these were prepared without interruption until 1944. During the years of the Second World War, several special circulars were newly introduced such as the Radio Observer. In 1944, the Confidential Foreign Policy Review or the Prices of Raw Materials on the World Market and Trade News were added. This collection of lithographs of the Hungarian News Agency consists of altogether twenty-one parts.
