Provenance unknown

The Regent's Park School was founded by Dr. Bruno Schindler and his wife, Alma in 1933 mainly for refugee children from Germany. It was the aim of the Schindlers to make the children as independent as possible as they knew that a number of them would probably never see their parents again.<br /><br />There was a strong emphasis on Judaism and Dr Schindler made it a rule that every Friday evening he would give a talk about the history of the Jews and Judaism. There were also many discussion groups on a variety of subjects led by the matron of the school.<br /><br />The aim of the school was thus to encourage independent thinking, an ability to act independently and a feeling that, despite adversity, it was possible for all to achieve the kind of life and standard of living from which most of the children had come. The fact that the school produced an exceptionally large number of men and women in the professions is ample proof of this.<br /><br />All this can be attributed to the guidance and general atmosphere created by Dr. and Mrs. Schindler. There was also a strong emphasis on sports.
