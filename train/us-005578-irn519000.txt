2

Consists of papers related to the Holocaust and immigration experiences of the family of Isac and Lydia Hirschfeld, originally of Liebau, Latvia. Isac Hirscheld passed away before the war, and once the war began, Lydia and her daughters Fanny, Frida, and Marie were interned, first in the Riga ghetto, and later in a forced labor camp. The collection includes a wartime address book, Fanny's diary, kept while in forced labor, and wartime correspondence. In 1944, Fanny volunteered to accompany a cousin on a transfer to Stutthof, where she perished. Lydia, Frida, and Marie survived the war and spent a year in a displaced persons camp (where Marie and Frida both married) before immigrating to the United States in May 1946 aboard the US Marine Flasher. The collection also includes a journal written by Marie while traveling to the DP camp, the passenger tickets for the Marine Flasher, and newspaper clippings regarding the ship's arrival.
