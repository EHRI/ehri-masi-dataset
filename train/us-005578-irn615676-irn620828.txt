I'm An American -- Anton Carlson

On April 6, 1941 Anton “Ajax” Carlson spoke with Ugo Carusi, Executive Assistant to the Attorney General, about what America means to him. Carlson shares his rags to riches immigration story. He tells of Americans' first impression of him. The professor also explains how he chose a career in physiology and his passion for teaching American youth. Dr. Carlson believes listening to a dictator’s false promise of security through the degradation of others will not build a better America. He shares his opinion on the events in Europe and the destiny of America. Dr. Carlson says the greatest gift that America has given him is the privilege to work and share in making democracy work. Anton “Ajax” Julius Carlson was born on January 29, 1875 in Svarteborg, Sweden. In 1891, he came to the United States alone, hardly knowing any English. He received his doctorate in physiology at Stanford in 1902. He became the chairman of the Physiology Department at the University of Chicago in 1916 and remained chairman until 1940. On February 10, 1941, Carlson appeared on the cover issue of Time Magazine for his success as a teacher; as well as his comparative studies of the muscular action of the heart in humans and the horseshoe crab. The prominent physiologist was one of 34 original signers of the Humanist Manifesto which establishes a progressive philosophy of life, without supernaturalism, that affirms the individual’s ability and responsibility to lead an ethical life that aspires to the greater good of humanity. In 1953, Carlson was the first person to receive the American Humanist Association's Humanist of the Year award.
