The collection documents the experiences of Donald Norton Pitts, who served as a foreign service officer with the State Department in Warsaw, Poland in 1950. Included are notes, reports, and writings, primarily about the political climate in Poland; diary; correspondence; identification card; clipping; and negatives taken while Donald was stationed there. These negatives include depictions of Denmark; Poland, Berlin, Stuttgart, Zurich; May Day celebrations in Poland; Biaystok, Warsaw; and SS Batory. Additionally, there are copy negatives, a glass negative, and copy prints depicting atrocities committed in Poland against Jews during the Holocaust. Accompanying documentation indicates the photos were likely taken circa 1939-circa 1939, and include roundups and forced-marches of Jews, German firing squads, executions, and corpses. The copy negatives were possibly received by a person named Halina, per a signed note by Halina, or the journalist Larry Allen, whom Donald mentions in his diary (May 17), and specifically describes receiving some negatives from.
