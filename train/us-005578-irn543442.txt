Ernst Deutsch was born to a Jewish family in Vienna, Austria on 26 January 1919. He immigrated to the United States in 1939 aboard the SS Aquitania with the aid of relatives who were already living in the U.S.A. Before receiving his American naturalization papers, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and was eventually sent back to Europe. Ernst served in the U.S. Army "Rainbow Division" as an interpreter and driver in Germany. He was among the first American units to enter the Dachau concentration camp and was decorated for his service with the Bronze Star after returning to the U.S.
