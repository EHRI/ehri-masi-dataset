German Feldpost letters and photograph of Wehrmacht soldier

8 pieces

The material seems to come from a German family in Wertheim am Main. It is unknown how and when it was deposited at the Wiener Holocaust Library.

Various letters, including personal correspondence and Feldpost letters. Envelopes with stamps showing Adolf Hitler. One envelope is a folded map, presumably showing a part of Russia. Correspondence includes among others announcement of death of a young German soldier at Stalingrad and a thank you letter of another soldier. The latter contains a photograph of this Wehrmacht-soldier in Russia with handwritten caption on the verso.
