1 electronic resource (9 Pages)

The file contains personal data sheets of three children from Polish / German families and the opinion of a doctor from the Rasse-und Siedlungsamt stating whether they are fit for the Germanization process. The children are two boys named Eugen Bartczak and Zdzislaw Denuszek which have been found racial desirable, and a girl named Stefanie Kordiasch whose Germanization, according to the doctor, cannot be warranted.
