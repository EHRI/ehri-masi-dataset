Gerda Buchheim Haas (1914-2012) was born in Berlin to Meier (Max) Buchheim and Paula Rosenthal Buchheim. She married John (Hans) Ivan Haas(z) in 1935 and their son, Henry, was born in 1938. They left Germany that same year for Czechoslovakia and eventually traveled to Shanghai in 1939 to join her sister’s and her husband’s families. They immigrated to the United States in 1947 and traveled first from San Francisco to Portland before settling in Tacoma, Washington. Her parent did not survive a March 1943 transport to Auschwitz.

The Gerda Buchheim Haas photograph and memoir include a black and white photograph of Gerda Buchheim Haas with her son Henry in Shanghai in 1941 and a 1996 memoir describing her experiences growing up in Berlin, fleeing to Czechoslovakia in 1938 and eventually to Shanghai via Italy and France in 1939, living in the Jewish ghetto under the Japanese occupation, and immigrating to the United States in 1947.
