Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 03 Pim (Constance) Combrink-Van Huizen Project 'Late gevolgen van Sobibor'

Constance (Pim) Combrink-van Huizen was born in Velsen. In 1939, after her parents were divorced, Constance, her Jewish mother, and her four and a half year older sister moved to Huizen. One evening they were rounded up and transported to Westerbork; the two sisters were released soon because they were half-Jewish, but Constance's mother was deported to Sobibor, where she was killed upon arrival. Constance, although half-Jewish, went into hiding with a friend of her mother and her two sons in Bussum. Later she came into the family of "uncle" Wim and "aunt" Toos and their three children in Santpoort. She kept house here and stayed until a year after the war. On Dolle Dinsdag (Mad Tuesday) her father, a member of the NSB movement and in search of her whereabouts, left for Germany, and from that moment onwards Constance felt freeer. Constance Combrink-van Huizen had five years of primary school education but was not able to go to school during the war. After the liberation she cherished hopes for her mother's return for many years.
