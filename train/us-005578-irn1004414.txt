Ufa logo onscreen. View of the Royal Palace in Copenhagen. Guards march on the snow-covered courtyard. Cars arrive for a traditional New Year's reception with the king (the king is not seen). One of the cars carries a German general in the backseat. Changing of the guard, then shots of men in bowler hats walking toward the palace. A man drives a horse-drawn carriage through the courtyard.
