Invasion of Poland

Funeral in Gdansk of Gauleiter Joseph Wessel, who was shot by a "Polish gang," followed by footage of ethnic German refugees fleeing alleged persecution by the Poles. CUs of women and blond children with tear-stained faces. Extreme CU of an older man wearing glasses and an older woman in a head scarf. Burning houses supposedly set on fire by the Poles. The newsreel cuts off abruptly.
