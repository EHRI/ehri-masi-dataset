Werner Jacob Lipton (Liebschüz) left Germany in 1939 for Switzerland where he lived in Kinderheime (children's homes).

Contains a collection of photocopied letters and postcards, most of which are to Werner Jacob Lipton (born Liebschütz) from his parents, Fanni and Jakob Liebschütz, his aunt and uncle, Max and Berta Bach, and his grandmother, Mina Liebschütz, and which deal with efforts to emigrate and family matters. In 1939, following increasing restrictions on German Jews, Werner's parents sent him to Switzerland where he lived in Kinderheime (children's homes). Fanni and Jakob Liebschütz were deported from Mindelheim, Germany, to the ghetto in Piaski, Poland, in March 1942; by June 1942 they were in the Lublin, Poland, area. Their last letters are farewell notes to their son indicating they are leaving for an unspecified location. Mina Liebschütz died in Theresienstadt concentration camp. Max and Berta Bach and died in an unnamed concentration camp. English-language translations by Werner Jacob Lipton and his cousin, Walter Heilbronner, are available.
