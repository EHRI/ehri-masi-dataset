United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of two large original pre-war portraits, one each of Esther Laub Neumann and of Markus Neumann, the parents of Hedy Neumann Reeds. The Neumanns perished in the Holocaust. Also includes copies of 35 pre-war photographs, some on album pages, of the Neumann family in Poland, and one copy of a photograph of James Reeds, who was part of the "Monuments Men," who investigated and discovered Nazi-looted art. In the photograph, Dr. Reeds is seen examining a discovered painting. He received a 2007 National Humanities Medal as a member of that group.
