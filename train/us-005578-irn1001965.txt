Idealized picture of Prussia to garner German support for total war

Reel 3 opens to find Mayor Nettelbeck sitting at a large table with his advisers. He reads an ultimatum he has received from the French. While some of the councillors recommend capitulation, Nettelbeck again argues that they must stand and fight, and he delivers a patriotic refusal to surrender to the French envoy. Napoleon is furious when he hears of the tiny city's insolence and promises that Kolberg will be taken without pity for its inhabitants. Back in Kolberg, the members of the Werner family celebrate a somber New Year's Eve with Nettelbeck and Schill. Nettelbeck laments the fact that they are stuck with Lucadou as commandant. Friedrich asks Schill whether he loves Maria. Schill answers that he does but that he will never marry a woman because he is married to the war. Maria and Schill nevertheless share an intimate toast. In the next scene we find that Nettelbeck has procured new cannons without Lucadou's permission. The enraged commandant argues with Nettelbeck and tells him that he intends to capitulate to the French. Nettelbeck draws his sword and leaps forward to attack Lucadou but is restrained. The next scene shows the French already outside Kolberg. Schill is rallying his troops when Maria arrives, frantic because the French have occupied her house with her father and brother Claus still inside. The scene changes to the interior of the house, where drunken Frenchmen hang from the chandelier. Claus drinks a toast to Napoleon and his disgusted father grabs his glass and spits on the ground.
