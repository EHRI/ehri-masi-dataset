Alexander Shalit (born Alexander Schalyt) was born on 13 August 1895 in Vitebsk, Russia (now Vitebsk, Belarus). He had at least one brother, Norman. His family immigrated to Bialystok, Poland around 1900, and moved to the Free City of Danzig after World War I. He was a furrier by trade, and eventually moved to Berlin, Germany. Alexander married Sima Tykotzki (1898-1968), and their son Larry (1924-2009) was born on 22 October 1924. Disturbed by the rise of Nazism, the Shalits moved to Brussels, Belgium in 1933, and immigrated to the United States in 1934. They settled in Detroit, Michigan in 1935. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Shalits corresponded with other family members, including Simaâ€™s relatives in the Tucker family (originally Tykotzki) in England and France. During World War II, Larry served in the United States Army from 1943-1946.

The collection contains correspondence, immigration papers, residence permits, identification papers and other related documentation regarding the immigration of Alexander and Sima Shalit, and their son Larry, from Berlin, Germany to the United States in 1934. Also included is earlier documentation from Russia (their country of origin), photographs, and correspondence and immigration documents from other relatives in Europe. Additionally, there is correspondence between Larry Shalit and his parents while he served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II.
