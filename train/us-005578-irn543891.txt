The Katz Ehrenthal Collection is a collection of more than 900 objects depicting Jews and antisemitic and anti-Jewish propaganda from the medieval to the modern era, in Europe, Russia, and the United States. The collection was amassed by Peter Ehrenthal, a Romanian Holocaust survivor, to document the pervasive history of anti-Jewish hatred in Western art, politics and popular culture. It includes crude folk art as well as pieces created by Europe's finest craftsmen, prints and periodical illustrations, posters, paintings, decorative art, and toys and everyday household items decorated with depictions of stereotypical Jewish figures.

Antisemitic, anti-Soviet German propaganda illustration distributed in contested Polish and Ukrainian war zones between 1941 and 1944. It was removed from a periodical. On one side is an illustration of an Orthodox Jew whispering in the ear of a savage looking Soviet soldier clutching a struggling woman in his arm. On the other side is a photograph of 4 distraught women displaced and wounded by the war. In September 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and divided Poland, which included Ukraine, per the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. On June 22, 1941, Germany broke the pact and invaded the Soviet Union. To frighten and gain the support of the local populations, Germany produced graphic propaganda showing Soviets and Jews committing horrible acts against civilians, especially children and women. It also emphasized the Soviet Unionâ€™s role as an aggressor nation advancing the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy to control the world. This illustraiotn is one of more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of anti-Semitic visual materials.
