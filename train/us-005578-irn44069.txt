Adela Hilzenrad (née Lantner, later Bar Eli, 1909-1998) was born in Stryj, Poland and had a sister Chana (Henia) Lantner and a brother Arthur Lantner, who perished during the war, and a brother, Henry J. Lantner, who left Poland before the war and studied in France. Adela married Dr. Mordechai (Marek and Markus) Hilzenrad (later Bar Eli, 1906-1971) who was born in Kolomea, Poland. Mordechai had two brothers, Benjamin, who left Poland for Israel before the war and “Salek” who was never seen again after the war. Mordechai and Adela had one son, Josaf (Joseph) born in 1934 in Drohobycz, Poland (present day Drohobycz, Ukraine). In 1945, Adela, Mordechai, and Joseph left Drohobych for Bytom, Poland where they stayed for a few months before illegally traveling to Leipheim, Germany where the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) had a large refugee camp. They left Leipheim in 1947 for France and boarded the SS Providence. In July 1947 they arrived in Haifa, Israel and settled in Tivon, a small community near Haifa.

The Hilzenrad family papers consist of a diary written by Adela Hilzenrad, in which she describes the events in Drohobycz, Poland from the German invasion in 1941 until liberation in 1944. The collection also includes pre-war and post-war photographs depicting the Lantner and Hilzenrad families in Drohobycz, Stryj, and the United States including images of Adela Hilzenrad, her son Josaf Hilzenrad, her husband Dr. Mordechai Hilzenrad, her sister Chana Lantner, and her brother Dr. Henry J. Lantner.
