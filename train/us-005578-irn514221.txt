Leon Felhendler, the son of a rabbi from ZoÃÅlkiewka, Poland, was a leader in the prisoner revolt at Sobibor concentration camp in October 1943. He and about 300 other prisoners at Sobibor escaped after staging an armed uprising at the camp. Felhendler successfully evaded Nazi pursuers after his escape from Sobibor, but was killed in 1945 by Polish Army troops.

The copy print is from an original photograph created in 1933 and depicts Leon Felhendler, Nicholas N. Kittrie's uncle.
