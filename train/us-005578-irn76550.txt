Jack Moses (1915-1996) was born in Burg bei Magdeburg, Germany to Julius Moses (1875-1956) and Louise (Liesbeth) Moses (1876-1968). He immigrated to the United States in 1934. His brother, Henry (1902-1991), followed in 1937, their parents arrived in 1939, and their sister, Martha (1904-1983), joined them in 1941. He served with the United States Army Counter Intelligence Corps from 1944 to 1946, spending one year in occupied Germany. Seventeen relatives perished in the Holocaust, most of them from his mother’s side of the family.

The Jack Moses papers consist of correspondence, identification papers, and photographs documenting Jack Moses, his family’s immigration to the United States, his military service during and after World War II, and the fate of relatives who remained behind in Europe. The bulk of the collection is comprised of Nazi-era newspapers and booklets. The collection also includes an SS membership booklet and a Nazi Party membership booklet for unrelated men.
