Selected trials of members of the Gestapo and the SD, soldiers, people who collaborated with Germans, high-ranking members of the French armed forces, and civilians accused of war crimes against humanity during WWII. The trials took place at the Military Tribunals in several places, e.g. Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseille, Metz, Paris,Tunis, and others, and consider following subjects: Camps, Criminales de Guerre (Individuals tried for war crimes); Gestap-SD; Massacres. The trials did not necessarily took place in the geographical region where the crimes were committed. On the contrary, the trials are often deliberately held at a distance from that place; Contains also a “Série 52”, the systematic search for war criminals over all of French territory (It is also called the SRCGE). Note: The tribunals were not under normal military jurisdiction for court martials, judging members of the military, but were called “extra-ordinary” and went by several names: “Tribunal militaire”-TM; “Tribunal militaire permanent”-TMP; “Tribunal permanent des forces alliés à Paris” (Permanent Tribunal of Allied Forces)-TFAP. Other helpful abbreviations: jgt- judgment, NL-non lieu (an affair was never brought to trial because the perpetrator died or the military tribunal declared itself not competent to judge the affair) or ONL (ordonnances de non lieu).
