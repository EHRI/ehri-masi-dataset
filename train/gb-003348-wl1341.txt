Antisemitism in Poland, pre-war: Unidentified document

1 folder

This document appears to be part of an address by a member of Rote Hilfe, a Polish socialist organisation. It attempts to demonstrate that the pogroms at Pizitik, Cracow, Lemberg and Radom were linked with the murder of the Polish working classes and that the Polish proletariat was not anti-Semitic and that the call for anti-Semitism comes from the government. The author exhorts Polish Jews not to emigrate, stating that they have a right to stay.
