Adam Emmanuel Appenzeller (donor's father) was born November 20, 1889 in Krakow. His wife Josefa Peppi Appenzeller was born March 16, 1902 in Jurcoutz, Bukovina. Adam studied in Vienna and became an architect. He moved to Chernovitz in Romania. Their son Otto was born there on December 11, 1927. Otto attended school until it stopped being possible and his parents hired tutors. In addition they purchased documents testifying that they are Roman Catholics; Evangelist or Greek Orthodox. Since Otto's paternal grandmother, Malwine Meissel Appenzeller came from then Czechoslovakia, Otto was able to serve in the Czech Army and not in a Soviet one. He left Czernowitz and his parents joined him in later in Prague. Otto fought in a battle for the Dukla pass under the command of Gen. Svoboda. In September 1946 he started medical school at the Charles University in Prague and graduated in 1949. His parents immigrated to Australia in early 1950 and Otto followed soon after. He currently lives in New Mexico with his wife Judith; their son Tim and his wife and children live in Washington, DC.
