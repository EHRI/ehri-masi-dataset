Tamara Grosfeld was born on September 1, 1929 in Dąbrowa Górnicza, Poland. Her father, Abraham Grosfeld, who was born in 1897, was ordained as a rabbi and a teacher of rabbinic studies. At an early age he abandoned the religious practice and became an ardent Zionist. He traveled to Vienna, Austria, where he became an apprentice to a carpenter in preparation for his Aliyah to Palestine. In 1921 Abraham and his wife, Lifsza Hirszfeld Grosfeld immigrated to Palestine and settled in Haifa. When Lifsza became pregnant she traveled back to Dabrowa Górnicza to give birth in her hometown. Unfortunately she died in childbirth and Tamara spent some time being taken care of by her maternal grandparents. In 1932, when Tamar was three years old, she traveled to Haifa, Palestine together with her maternal aunt, Gucia Hirszfeld. In Haifa, Abraham married Gucia and their son, Dan Grosfeld was born in 1936. The same year, Tamar and her mother-aunt went to visit their family in Dabrowa Górnicza. They spent four months in their hometown and returned to Haifa. All the family members, who remained in Poland, perished during the Holocaust. Tamar Grosfeld Klein and her family reside in Haifa, Israel.

The photograph collection consists of photographs depicting the Hirszfeld and Grosfeld families in Dąbrowa Górnicza prior to World War II. Tamar Grosfeld Klein and her family were living in Haifa during World War II. All of her family members who remained in Poland perished during the Holocaust.
