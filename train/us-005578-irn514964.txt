Dr. Hans Landesberg, born in Vienna, Austria, graduated from medical school and travelled to Spain to become a member of the International Brigade. After the Spanish Civil War, he was arrested in France and sent to Djelfa, Algeria in April 1941. He began to work on obtaining a visa to the United States and was approved in October 1941. He travelled to Morocco to leave from Casablanca. Unfortunately, there were no ships sailing for the US within the 14 days he was legally allowed to be in Morocco, so he was again sent to Sidi-el-Ayashi, Morocco from October 1941 to February 1943, when he was finally allowed to leave. He reached New York City on April 7, 1943, where he became a practicing physician.

Consists of material related to the pre-war and wartime experiences of Dr. Hans Landesberg. Includes passports, photographs of family members and of Dr. Landesberg in the Sidi-el-Ayashi concentration camp in Morocco, correspondence, official papers, and a brief memoir describing his experiences, both in German and in English.
