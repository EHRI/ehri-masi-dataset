Battle near Ladoga Lake (Leningrad)

Map showing Leningrad. The narrator announces: "on the front, south of the Ladoga Lake." View of "hedgehog" fortifications (crisscrossed iron bars strung with barbed wire) in the snow. A German soldier in a white snowsuit and helmet and with a rifle slung over his shoulder, looks out at the scene. Another soldier, also on watch, stands in a trench. "Bolshevist tanks attack! Here they come!" announces the narrator, as German soldiers rush across the snow. Soldiers loading and firing howitzers and rifles as they defend their position against the Soviets. Shots of a number of damaged Soviet tanks in the snow. Germans inspect one of them. A close-up shot of a German tank (described by the narrator as a "Sturmgeschuetz") rolling across the snow, accompanied by infantrymen in white snowsuits. A large explosion in the distance causes two troops to hit the ground - the narrator says that the Soviets have noticed the movements of the Germans. Sounds of explosions and rifle fire while the Germans hold their positions and then attempt to advance.
