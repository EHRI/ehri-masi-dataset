Eugenia Hochberg Lanceter, her parents Bernard and Diana Harmelin Hochberg, and her brother, Sigmund lived in Brody, Poland (Brody, Ukraine) until the Nazi occupation in June 1941. Bernard Hochberg was deported to a labor camp in ZboroÃÅw, Poland (Zboriv, Ukraine), where he remained for five months until his wife purchased his freedom. The Hochberg's went to the Brody ghetto on May 21, 1943. Eugenia was sent for forced labor to various sites outside the ghetto and performed secretarial tasks in the Judenrat offices. The family was rounded up during the final liquidation of the Brody ghetto on May 21, 1943, and deported by train to Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin, Poland. During the deportation, Eugenia's parents forced her to jump from the train before reaching Majdanek. A railroad worker saved her and offered her temporary shelter. Eugenia went back to Brody where she smuggled herself into a forced labor camp, and later smuggled herself out again and spent the remainder of the war in hiding. Following liberation in March 1944, Eugenia lived in Brody and Lublin and married Henryk Lanceter in July 1945. Five months after marrying, the couple left for Germany entered the Finkenschlag displaced persons camp in Furth where their daughter was born. The family immigrated to the United States aboard the SS General Holbrook in the summer of 1949.
