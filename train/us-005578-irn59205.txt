Contains a letter from Julius Kohn, of Vienna, dated July 25, 1939, sent to Mrs. Sedonia Kohn in New York, seeking an affidavit that would allow him and his family to immigrate to the United States. Mr. Kohn did not know Mrs. Kohn, and likely wrote to her because of the shared last name. Ultimately, Mr. Kohn did not receive an affidavit and he and his family were deported to Maly Trostenets in 1942, where they were killed.
