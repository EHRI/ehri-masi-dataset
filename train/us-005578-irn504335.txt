Freda Karpul (1924-2020) was born Freda Fridmanaite on 5 December 1924 in Skaudvilė, Lithuania to Abraham Fridman and Chaie Sara Segal. She had four siblings. In June 1940 Russia occupied Lithuania, and Freda remained in Skaudvilė until July 1941 when it was occupied by Germany. Her father was rounded up with the other men and murdered in a nearby forest. Freda, her mother, and two sisters were deported to Batakiai. After two months, they fled and hid in the forest for over a year. They were discovered while in hiding and her mother was killed by Lithuanian police. Freda and her sister survived in hiding on a farm. After becoming ill, she and her sister were taken to the Kovno ghetto (Kaunas) where she recovered. Freda was liberated by the Soviet Red Army in October 1944. She later immigrated to the United States and settled in Chicago, IL. She had one daughter, Sophie.
