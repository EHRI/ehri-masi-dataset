Speeches by Hess/Goebbels re: Jews & Bolshevism

Hess speaks to audience (not compellingly). CU of Hitler seated, looking distracted, glum. Hess leads "Sieg Heils." Goebbels speaks with authority and command. Crowd of SS behind him. "International Jewish conspiracy...and its pathological...goal of destruction of European culture."
