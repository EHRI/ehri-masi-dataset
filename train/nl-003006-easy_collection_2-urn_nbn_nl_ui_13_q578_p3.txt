Sobibor Interviews 1983-1984, interview 06, Jules Schelvis

Interview with Jules Schelvis (Amsterdam 7 January 1921). Schelvis was put on transport from Westerbork on 1 June 1943 with his wife and in-laws. He brought his guitar as a 'welcome distraction to take our mind off things'. On arrival in Sobibor he managed at the last moment to join a group of men who were selected for labour in the peat camp of Dorohucza. Jules Schelvis was one of the eighteen Dutch Jews who survived Sobibor.
