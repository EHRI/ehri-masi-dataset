German election material

5 folders

These political flyers were purchased from an antiquarian bookseller in Haarlem, Netherlands. The antiquarian bought it from the original collector's son.

It was the collection of a German Jewish communist, who flew to Palestine around 1936.

The collection consists of election material covering the era of the Weimar Republic, especially the last years. There are many flyers from the NSDAP, but also other parties, like the Zentrum, the SPD and the KPD.
