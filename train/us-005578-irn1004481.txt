Propaganda Kompanie members in training

Shot of a sign on a door which reads "Nicht stoeren Unterricht" (do not disturb: lecture). A uniformed man speaks while standing in front of many broadsheet newspapers posted on the wall. Uniformed Propaganda Kompanie (PK) reporters at work in the field: a man lying on the ground outdoors takes notes; a man sitting on the running board of a car uses a typewriter. Returning to the man from the first scene, he is now standing in front of several maps as he lectures to a class (dark interior shot). A bald man makes a show of typing badly and with great effort. In a stenography and writing class (?) an instructor shows the students the components of a typewriter (?). Shot of a tape recorder. Men in a class practice typing. Typesetting and printing a newspaper.
