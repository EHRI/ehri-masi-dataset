Simon Goldman (1929-2010) was born on April 1, 1929 in Łódź, Poland to Jacob and Rachel Ksztan (d. 1939), who were observant Jews and probably also from Łódź. He had three brothers and one sister: Yechiel, Manya, Wewel, and Abram. Simon was briefly located in Siedlce after World War I started. He managed to be hired as a cow hand and passed as a gentile on a farm from the end of 1941 until liberation using the name of a former neighbor of his in Łódź, Marion Kowalski. None of his family survived the Holocaust. In 1945 on Yom Kippur he was sent to the Bindermichl DP camp and remained there until his immigration to the United States in 1946. He arrived aboard the SS Marine Marliner on December 20, 1946, spent ten days in New York City, and then was sent to Cleveland before settling in Detroit. He joined the US Army in 1951 and married a Holocaust survivor.

The Simon Goldman photographs include 17 photographs of Simon Goldmand and his friends at the Bindermichl Displaced Persons camp in Austria. The collection also inclues a floppy disc.
