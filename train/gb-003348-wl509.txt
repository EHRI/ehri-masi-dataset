The first part (509/I) consists of correspondence between Danzig Jewish community representatives and members of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig and reports of meetings between the two organisations. The outstanding feature of this material is the continuous repetition of complaints concerning anti-Semitic outrages such as boycott, display of Streicher's paper <em>Der St√ºrmer</em> and the public singing of the stormtroopers' song "When Jews' blood spurts from the knife, things go twice as well". Assurances are invariably given by Dr. Rauschning, then chairman of the Senate, who seems genuinely troubled, but in 1935 goes into exile. He was intermittently supported by his deputy, Arthur Greiser, an ardent Nazi, who in the early days paid lip service to the Jewish community's concerns, but who showed his true colours, when they protested once more that their complaints went unheeded by taking grave offence at this "gross insult to the government" and informing the Jews that their complaints would henceforth remain unattended.</p>
