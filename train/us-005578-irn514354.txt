The photograph depicts a pile of corpses at Dachau concentration camp at the time of its liberation. A caption on the back of the photograph reads: "These bodies were piled up to be cremated but were caught before they could complete the job. Besides that there were three carloads of bodies that were not unloaded when the place was overrun."
