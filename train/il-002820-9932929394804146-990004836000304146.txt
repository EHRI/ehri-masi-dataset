1 electronic ressource (2 pages)

This file contains a note written by Bourtzeff, date and location unspecified. Judging by the content of the note, he leaves no doubt that it was written not long before the beginning of the Bern trials. In the note Bourtzeff talks about an old friend of his: Harting, now deceased. Bourtzeff found 20 large diaries written by Harting, in which he mentions the Protocols. Bourtzeff engages in a conversation with the two sons that Harting left behind and that will inherit all his belongings, including the diaries. He asked them to think about giving him the diaries so he can eventually use them as proofs for his cause in the upcoming Bern trials. The note ends with Bourtzeff writing that he hopes for a positive answer.
