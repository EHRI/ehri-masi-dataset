György Wallenfels (1910-1945) was born on 2 June 1910 in Budapest, Hungary to Simon Wallenfels (1860-1911) and Janka Traub (b. 1877). He had two brothers, Simon (d. 1945), and Samuel (d. 1945). György sold textile fabric in Budapest, and married Illona Waldmann (1913-1946) who was in the poultry business. Their son Miklos was born on 14 July 1934, and their daughter Eva was born on 9 March 1937. In 1939, György was conscripted into the Hungarian army, and was later sent to a forced labor camp. He died of typhus in 1945. Illona, Miklos, and Eva were sent to the ghetto in Budapest in November 1944. In December 1944, Illona was deported to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, and then to the Buchenwald concentration camp in early 1945. Both of György’s brothers perished during the Holocaust. After the end of the war, they were reunited, and lived with Miklos’s grandmother in Budapest. Illona died in 1946 from cardiovascular problems. Miklos studied engineering. He and Manya Stauner (b. 1936), also a Holocaust survivor, emigrated from Hungary in 1956 to the United States.
