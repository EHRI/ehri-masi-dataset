Karl Rosenthal was born in Germany. Before the Holocaust, he was president of some B'nai B'rith lodges and a leader of the Centralverein Deutscher Staatsburger Judischen Glaubens. He was also a member of the association for German Jewish War Veterans as well as a rabbi of Berlin's reformed Jewish congregation. During the Holocaust, he was imprisoned by the Nazis, his wife, Gertrude, was held in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, and his youngest son, Siegfried, was apparently shot and killed at Mauthausen concentration camp. He and his surviving family eventually immigrated to the United States. In time, he became the rabbi of the Temple of Israel (reformed) synagogue of Wilmington, North Carolina.
