Ann Hershkowitz was born Hanka Schudmak on 3 February 1925 in Chrzanów, Poland to Jakob and Gitla Schudmak (née Bachner). She had four siblings: Itka, Moishe, Ruchla, and Salomon (b. 1923). In February 1942 Ann was sent to the Schoenberg forced-labor camp. In 1943 she was deported to the Graeben subcamp of Gross-Rosen and transferred to Bergen-Belsen in September 1944. She was liberated on 15 April 1945. Her sister Itka was also liberated, but perished on 27 May 1945 from typhoid fever. Salomon and Ruchla both survived the Holocaust.

The papers consist of an identification card issued to Hanka Schudmak (later Ann Hershkowitz) and stating that she was a prisoner at Bergen-Belsen, two photographs of Hanka standing near the grave of her younger sister, Itka Schudmak, at the International Cemetery at Bergen-Belsen, and a photograph of the gravestone of Itka Schudmak. Itka Schudmak, Ann Herschkowitz's younger sister, died of typhoid fever on May 27, 1945, after liberation at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
