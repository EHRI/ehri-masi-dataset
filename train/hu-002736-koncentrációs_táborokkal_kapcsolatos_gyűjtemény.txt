Koncentrációs táborokkal kapcsolatos gyűjtemény

ca. 4 linear metres

The collection of archival documents is based on the material of the Hungarian Auschwitz Foundation (HFA), an NGO established in 1990 by survivors to collect and preserve documentation pertaining to the Holocaust. HFA collected copies of archival material from several Hungarian public collections as well as original private documents donated by other institutions and individuals. The collection was handed over to the newly established Holocaust Memorial Center in 2004. From that time on, more than 800 individuals donated the HMC their private and family documents, photos and objects.

The documents in HMC’s collection pertaining to concentration camps were mostly created by Allied armies and Allied-controlled civil authorities, DP camps and organizations attending deportees in the territory of the former Nazi Germany. They also contain private files of survivors.

The collection includes various types of private documents, including identification papers, passports, inventories, letters and postcards, diaries and notebooks, birth, death and marriage certificates, work and travel permits, protective documents and other personal documents as well as administrative and legal documents that were in the custody of families and individuals. Personal files also include about 2500 photographs and more than one thousand of objects and artifacts.
