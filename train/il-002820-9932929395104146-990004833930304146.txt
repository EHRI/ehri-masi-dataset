The economic campaign of annihilation against German Jewry

1 electronic resource (28 pages)

The file contains several reports regarding the economic campaign of annihilation against German Jewry published by the Jewish Central Information Office. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). After a period of a certain outward relaxation brought by the need for Olimpic quite in summer 1936 the fight against the Jewish population went on again. Pressure on Jewish proprietors was put in order to force them to sell their businesses. Further the exclusion of Jewish employees from business establishments still went on. This applied in particular to banks and insurance companies. Also people who worked for the state were forbidden to patronize Jewish establishments or consult them, in addition customers were prevented from entering into Jewish premises. Worse than the economic campaign of annihilation and the displacement was the contempt and degradation of Jewry as a body of ther relogion, which glare at the German Jews from the pages of every newspaper and resound in every speech. In this connection the judgments of the German courts are of special significance. Far more than the material injury the Jews suffer as a result of the hostile anti-Jewish sentences of the German judges. In addition an other report explains how Jewish organisations have to suffer because of the GESTAPO. Meetings of Jewish organisations had to be announced and requested in advance, follow a strict orders given by the government and relinquish all informations about the participants.
