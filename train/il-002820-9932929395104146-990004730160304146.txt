1 electronic resource (23 pages)

The file contains a report by Wilhelm Baum, Press Councilor of the German Embassy of Moscow and representative of Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau (WTB) to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin dated 22.08.1933 as an answer to decree P2143 from 26.04.1933 regarding Anti-German propaganda in the Soviet Union. There is propaganda against Germany since 30.01.1933 and even more since 05.03.1933, which can be considered as propaganda by the Soviet Regime itself, as there is no freedom of the press or freedom of the speech. The report elaborates the character and background of this propaganda and covers also influences of French and Polish political and cultural propaganda. Other topics mentioned are propaganda by Czechoslovakia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Romania, the influences of German emigres and German newspapers, cultural relationships between Germany and the Soviet Union and German counter-propaganda. There is a need for further in-debth consultations regarding the German-Soviet relationship, as it is very important, but also very difficult at the moment.
