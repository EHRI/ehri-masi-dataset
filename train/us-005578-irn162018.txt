Wanda Neumark (Neimark) was born in Łódź, Poland, in 1919 to Ewa and Salomon Neumark. She had two younger sisters, Hala, (later Helen Fagin) born in 1922, and Teresa, born in 1930. They were raised in Radomsko. In September 1939, Germany invaded and occupied Poland. The Jewish population of Radomsko were confined to a ghetto. Wanda escaped the ghetto with the help of Henryk Wroblewski. She assumed a non-Jewish alias, Natalia Władysława Drozdowska. She was living in Busko-Zdrój when the city was liberated in January 1945 by Soviet forces. The war ended when Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945. She learned that her parents were deported and murdered in Treblinka killing center in September 1942. Wanda and her sisters left for Austria. Wanda worked for United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Wels and Badgstein displaced persons camps. In June 1946, Wanda married a Jewish American soldier Jacob Lomazow (1917-2012) and, in October, immigrated to the United States. Wanda, 67, passed away in 1986.
