1 electronic resource (4 pages)

The first part of the file is a writing by the editor's office of "Das Schwarze Korps"[of chief editor Gunter d' Alquen] to [Reinhard]Höhn of the "Sicherheitsdienst Reichsführung SS" (Security Service of the National Leadership SS),[which is the Main Security Office], dated 01/06/1937. It mentions an attached letter by [Felix]Genzmer from Tübingen about Schmitt to be published in "Das Schwarze Korps". The second part of the file is a letter by Hans Frank to [Gunter]d' Alquen [,chief editor of the "Das Schwarze Korps",] about articles attacking Schmitt in the last issue of the newspaper. Hans Frank is taking sides with Schmitt. According to Frank's opinion, these attacks only repeat what has been written in the foreign press against Schmitt as a hate campaign by Jewish emigres. Hans Frank asks [Gunter]d' Alquen to read three articles from foreign newspapers as evidence for his opinion. These articles were presumably written by Jewish authors like Waldemar G[?]urian, under the pseudonym Paul Mülller. Hans Frank expresses his hope that if these things would have been known to [Gunter]d' Alquen, there would not have been any publication of the articles attacking Schmitt in "Das Schwarze Korps". Hans Frank mentions that he sent a copy of this letter to [Heinrich]Himmler. The third part of the file is an index page referring to the newspaper "Het Volk" from Amsterdam. Below is a note on issue number 14338, dated 01/08/1937: The "Deutsche Juristen Zeitung" (Newspaper of German Jurists) was discontinued with closing words by [Hans]Frank and its last editor-in-chief Schmitt. Schmitt used to be Privy Counsellor, Professor and had a leading post at the "Nationalsozialistischer Rechtswahrerbund" (NSRB; National Socialist Association of German Legal Professionals) until recently. He resigned from office a few weeks ago, allegedly due to poor health, but in reality because of sharp attacks from national socialist circles, e.g. from the newspaper "Das Schwarze Korps".
