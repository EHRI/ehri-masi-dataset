Marianne Salomon was born to Josef and Hildegard (née Grünewald) Salomon in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. In October 1938, at the age of six, her family immigrated to the United States on the "New York," a ship on the Hamburg Amerika Line. They were sponsored by Josef's younger brother, Gustav, who had immigrated earlier and was already a United States citizen. After arriving in New York, Josef and Hildegard had difficulty finding work, so the family moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where they remained throughout the war. Marianne later married Alfred Berg, who had immigrated to the United States from Vienna in 1939. The couple had two children and three grandchildren and lived in New Jersey. Alfred Berg passed away in 2013.

Consists of a photograph, documents, and booklets owned by Marianne Salomon, originally of Frankfurt, Germany, who immigrated with her parents to the United States in 1938, eventually settling in Iowa. Includes a pre-war photograph of Marianne; inventory and shipping correspondence related to the family's personal possessions in the late 1930s; documents related to the family's Oct. 1938 immigration to the United States on the Hamburg Amerika Line ship "New York"; Joseph and Hildegard Salomon's naturalization papers; a map of Des Moines and welcome book for Iowa; and a war bonds stamp book used by Marianne.
