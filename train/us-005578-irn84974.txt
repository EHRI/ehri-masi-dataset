Collection of photographs, correspondence and documents relating to the Weiss and Ross families living in Liptovská Teplá, Slovakia. The photographs depict family life; the wedding of Alexander and Blanka Weiss in June 1937; birth of Peter in 1939; and their life till their escape into hiding. The documents include two Red Cross letters from Blanka Weiss to her father, dated October 1943 and January 1944; a Czech passport; an identification card issued to the donor by the Government of the Netherlands West Indies island of Aruba; the donor's driver's license from Aruba; and a copy of a certificate issued by the City Hall of Nemecka Lupca stating that Alexander Weiss (donor's father) and the donor's maternal grandparents were murdered by the Germans. Alexander was killed in September 1944 and Peter and his mother were deported first to Sered transit camp and in December 1944 they were transferred to Theresienstadt concentration camp. They were liberated on May 8, 1945. Blanka’s father, Max Ross, resided in the US, but even after the war it was impossible to obtain US immigration visa, so Blanka and her son Peter emigrated to Cuba, Dominican Republic and Aruba. Only in 1957 they were able to come to the US.
