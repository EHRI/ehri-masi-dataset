The fragments of the survived records of the Hungarian embassies and other diplomatic corps were handed over to the Hungarian National Archives in 1950. The material was reorganized at the end of the 1950s and in the 1960s-1970s as well. The first finding aids were published in 1959 and 1964, followed by an revised second edition in 2003.
The material of the Hungarian Consulate in Geneva is divided into seven major thematic groups: two of them, the Political and the Classified Records (no. III-IV.) contain relevant information on Hungarian Jews and the Holocaust (Fascicles 68, 154 and 163.).

The Hungarian Secretariat at the League of Nations (from 1925: Royal Hungarian Agency at the League of Nations) was established in Geneva in 1923. In 1939, it was converted to a Consulate General, and operated until 1945. The majority of the records were created by Hungarian representative at the League of Nations László Velics (1935-1939) and his associates.

Records of the Hungarian Agency at the League of Nations and its successor (from 1939), the Hungarian Consulate in Geneva, Switzerland, contain material concerning Hungarian Jews from 1920 to 1939. The overwhelming majority of the records are from 1938 and 1939. The most relevant parts of the collection include various reports concerning the “Jewish question”, Zionism and the Palestine problem between 1930 and 1939, comprehensive political reports, and general documents pertaining to Hungarian Jews, such as demographical statistics and charts, the memorandum of Foreign Minister Kálmán Kánya, reports about the World Jewish Congress in May 1938, and the conference in Evian in July 1938. The post-1939 part of the collection has little relevance for the history of the Hungarian Jews and the Holocaust.
