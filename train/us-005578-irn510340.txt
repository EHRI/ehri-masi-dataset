Julian Feingold (1918-1990) was born in Poland and educated at the Institute for Fine Arts in Poznań and the Art Institute of Lwów. During the war he escaped east, was sent to the Soviet interior, and evacuated to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. He returned home after the war to discover that his entire family had perished. He left Poland for the Zeilsheim displaced persons camp and immigrated to the United States where he worked as a cartoonist, graphic artist and book illustrator.

The Julian Feingold papers include photographs of Feingold’s artwork documenting the Zeilsheim displaced persons camp and of a theatre production at Zeilsheim; clippings about Feingold, his wife, and the Holocaust; and a reproduction of a drawing by Feingold of a military photographer with Holocaust survivors in the background.
