Fred Loeb was born Friedrich Löb on March 7, 1925 to Arthur and Marie Löb (née Lehmann). Fred and his sister Anneliese Löb (later Anne Marx) grew up in Malsch, Germany. Their father was the founder and owner of a cigar factory. In November 1938 during Kristallnacht Arthur was imprisoned the Dachau but was released on condition that he leave Germany. In January 1939, Arthur immigrated to Cuba with his brothers Friedrich and Leopold. In February or March 1939, Fred left for Cuba with his Aunt Erna Forsch. On May 13, 1939, ten members of the extended Löb family sailed on the MS St. Louis for Cuba. After the MS St. Louis was denied entry to Cuba and forced to return to Europe, most of the family disembarked in Belgium and lived in Brussels. In April 1940, Fred’s mother, sister, sailed with other family members from Antwerp, Belgium to New York on the SS Penland. The rest of the family was unable to escape following the Nazi invasion of Belgium.

Two Cuban entry permits issued by Manuel Benitez Gonzales, Director of Cuban Immigration, for members of the Loeb family and members of the Lehmann/Herz family.
