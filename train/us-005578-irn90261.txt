Consists of one typed translation of a memoir, approximately 47 pages, entitled "The Struggle for Life" by Feivel (Shraga) Solomiansky. In the memoir, he describes hiding during two German raids on his hometown of Iliya (now Ilʹi︠a︡), when inhabitants were rounded up and shot, and his subsequent escape to the nearby forest, where he hid and eventually joined a partisan group. He describes raids against German units and German-held towns; attempts to free Jews from ghettos; a raid in Miadel (Myadel); the daily life of his unit; a raid on the Lida airport; and finally encountering the Red Army. The translation was completed by Mira and Ted Mordfin with the assistance of Neil Roland.
