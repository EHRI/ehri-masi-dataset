American POWs captured at the Battle of the Bulge

Capture of American POWs at the Battle of the Bulge in December, 1944. The soldiers exit a house with their hands raised. Destroyed tanks, one of which bears the motto "America First." Sepp Dietrich at the front. A field littered with war materiel, including destroyed Sherman tanks. American POWs, some of them wounded, struggle through the mud. Germans shoot at American bombers. Children wave at a passing German tank in a "German village." General Walther Model directs his troops in various activities. A column of American POWs trudges past the camera. The camera lingers on the faces of African American prisoners, then juxtaposes them with the faces of German soldiers. German tanks roll by a barbed wire enclosure containing American POWs. German soldiers drink from bottles of wine and smoke cigarettes. Tanks roll through the narrow streets of a town.
