The Joint-Stock Russian-Canadian-American Passenger Company” (RUSCAPA) was set up in the early 1920s as a joint-stock company whose members were Russian, Canadian, and American passenger carriers. Its central Moscow office, Kyiv branch, and representatives operating throughout Ukraine helped Soviet citizens to process the necessary emigration documents and arranged for their exit of the USSR and entrance to the USA, Canada, and Latin America.

The collection contains records of the “Joint-Stock Company Russo-Canadian-American Passenger Agency” (“Aktsionernoe obshchestvo Russkocanadsko-amerikanskoe passazhirskoe agenstvo”) (RUSCAPA) related to thousands of families emigrating from the Soviet Union in 1926-1930. It includes personal files of emigrants (Jews, Ukrainians, Germans, Poles, Russians), questionnaires, medical certificates, business correspondence with customers, receipts for payment of services, personal letters and telegrams filled out and submitted in order to exit the USSR and enter the USA and Canada, and other important documentation related to personal information of family members, as the age, marital status, health, level of literacy, and finances. More than 80% of the records of the 1,470 dossiers are related to the Soviet Jews emigrants. Dossiers range in size between 3 and 150 pages.
