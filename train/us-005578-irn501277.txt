The Irvin H. and Sybil Stern collection consists of photographs of the Mauthausen concentration camp, taken by Irvin Stern on May 10, 1945. The photographs show the camp following liberation and include images of survivors and victims, the mass burial of corpses, as well as buildings, fences, and the crematorium. The letters, in the form of memoirs, relate to the Irvin Stern's experiences at Mauthausen and how he came in contact with Dal Lorvic, a Yugoslavian resistance fighter and a survivor of Mauthausen concentration camp.
