Jews in Russia : with half-Jews and "damped" Jews : with a list of the names of the 447 Jews in the Soviet Government of Russia

Jews in Russia with Half-Jews and "Damped" Jews

The pamphlet was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2016 by the Katz Family.

The Katz Ehrenthal Collection is a collection of more than 900 objects depicting Jews and antisemitic and anti-Jewish propaganda from the medieval to the modern era, in Europe, Russia, and the United States. The collection was amassed by Peter Ehrenthal, a Romanian Holocaust survivor, to document the pervasive history of anti-Jewish hatred in Western art, politics and popular culture. It includes crude folk art as well as pieces created by Europe's finest craftsmen, prints and periodical illustrations, posters, paintings, decorative art, and toys and everyday household items decorated with depictions of stereotypical Jewish figures.

Pamphlet by Victor E. Marsden (1866-1920) which claims to expose Jewish control of the newly created Soviet government. Marsden, a journalist and translator, also created the most widely circulated translation of the antisemitic tract, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, published in 1923. This edition of the pamphlet was reprinted in the 1970s for distribution by the Sons of Liberty, a publisher of racist, antisemitic materials in Metairie, LA, affiliated with the white supremacist movement. This pamphlet is one of more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of antisemitic visual materials.
