Hanka Gorenstein (1923-2007) was born Chana Piterman in Osowa, Poland to merchants Meir Piterman and Sara Piterman (nee Erlichgrecht) and was raised in Łuck (now Lutsk, Ukraine). She attended the university in Lwów and happened to be on a university trip to Kamieniec Podolski (now Kamyanets-Podilsky, Ukraine) when Operation Barbarossa began. She returned to Łuck and was forced into the ghetto with her family. She survived the liquidation of the ghetto, but her family was murdered there. She lived under an assumed identity and worked as a farmhand in the Wołyń region (now Volhynia, Ukraine). After the war she married Josef Gorenstein in Vienna, and the couple emigrated to Israel.

The Hanka Gorenstein papers consists of a photograph of Hanka Gorenstein as a young woman and a re-transcribed memoir describing her experiences in Kamieniec Podolski and the Łuck ghetto, escaping the ghetto liquidation, hiding under a non-Jewish identity and working as a farmhand in Wołyń, and returning to Łuck after the war. In addition to the Polish version of the memoir, the collection also includes an English translation of the same.
