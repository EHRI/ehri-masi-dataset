Provenance unknown

Klara Rosenzweig was born in 1890 in Altleiningen, Rheinland Pfalz, and was deported to France from Mannheim in October in 1940. She was imprisoned at Gurs in the Basses Pyrenées from 22 October 1940 to 20 Jan 1942. She was then transferred to de Noé in the Haute Garonne until 3 August 1942. From there she was moved to Recebedon and thence to Drancy. Her name appears on the transport list of 'Convoy' No. 18 which left Drancy on 12 August 1942 and arrived at Auschwitz on 14 August 1942. It is assumed that she died very shortly after her arrival. The letter of 16 March 1941 carries a postscript signed by Bert Franck. The transport list of 12 August 1942 includes the name Bertha Franck, born 4 August 1875, Hunfeld, Germany.
