Erika Stolz (later Erica White, 1926-2016) was born in Vienna, Austria on November 18, 1926. Her father, Leon Stolz (1890-1953), was born in Stanisławów, Poland (currently Ivano-Frankivsk , Ukraine) to Efraim (1862-1929) and Katharina (1859-1938) Stolz and had eight siblings, Gedalje (Gustav, 1888-?), Eugenia (Genia, 1891-?), Salomea (Salka, 1893-1961), Berta (1895-?), Emila (1898-1943?), Joachim (Chaim, 1900-1941), Eva (1902-1991), and Ernestyna (1902-1943). Leon moved to Vienna with his siblings around World War I and later became a lawyer. Erika's mother, Rosa Klapholz (Roza, later Stolz and Renee or Rene Hutton, 1901-1986) was born in Vienna to Meilche (Max, 1874-1926) and Margula (Julie, née Pomeranz, 1882-?) Klapholz and had one brother, Benedick (Cylo, 1899-1968). She married Leon in September 1925. In the mid-1930s, Leon and Rosa separated and officially divorced in 1943. Following the German annexation of Austria, Erika was sent to England on a Kindertransport in January 1939 where she stayed in a boarding school in Slough, outside of London. Benedick, who immigrated earlier, worked for the Refugee Children's Movement and supported Erika's stay. Leon fled to Italy in 1940 and sailed to Shanghai where he lived for the remainder of the war. He later married Hermine Herliczka (or Hermina, later Sternbach then Stolz, born in 1904 to Max and Rosalia in Vienna) in 1948 and lived in Berlin. Rosa and her future husband, Kurt Hauptmann (1901-1976, later Kent Hutton, born in Austria to Emanuel Hauptmann and Golde Westreich) moved to Italy and remained in Rome until the early 1940s when they immigrated to the United States and changed their names to Kent and Renee Hutton. Erika finished her schooling in England and on April 21, 1944 she left for the United States to join her mother and stepfather. She met Dorian White in New York and they married on September 11, 1946 and had a son, Ronald. Erika's immediate family survived the war, but her grandfather, Efraim Stolz, was deported to Buchenwald and died on November 6, 1939 and Gustav disappeared behind Russian lines. Joachim was an ardent Zionist and signed up for the Kladovo transport to go to Palestine. The boat became stranded in Yugoslavia where he and most of the other passengers were killed. Ernestine and her husband were killed at Auschwitz in 1943.

Dorian White (born Isidor Weizenbaum, 1908-1986) was born on October 4, 1908 in Vienna, Austria to Heinrich (1877-1921) and Zlata (Charlotte, 1877-?) and had three siblings, Leon (1900-?), Arnold (1902-1972), and Oscar (1906-1977). They lived in Vienna where his father worked as a furrier. In 1921 his father passed away and his mother and brother moved to Paris. Following the start of World War II, Dorian and his brother were sent to a labor camp outside of Paris. Dorian escaped and made his way to the southern Free Zone where his mother was living. From there he crossed the border into Spain and later Portugal and sailed to Cuba. He immigrated to the United States in 1944. Dorian's mother died of natural causes in southern France and is buried in Marseille.
