Finzi Dante fu Giacomo. Antifascista

30 pages

Dante Finzi, born in Mantua in 1886, was labelled as "ebreo di razza" (of Jewish race) when he was condemned for “monetary infractions” in 1939, as he tried to bring liras out of the Italian border, to Switzerland. Actually, police report says that there was “an investigation going on about the Jews in order to avoid monetary smuggling”, and each one of the people involved together with Dante Finzi was clearly indicated as "Jewish" (underlined), if this was the case.
