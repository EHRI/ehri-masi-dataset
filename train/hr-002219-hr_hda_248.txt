The material was first inherited from the National University Library in 1978 and in 1984. Part of the material was taken from the Ministry of the Interior on the 24th October 1990; and finally in 1995 (acquisition # 52/1995) from the Institute for Contemporary History, which is a successor institution of the Institute for the History of Croatian Workers'Movement (IHRPH) and its archives. The collection has been sorted out in the Croatian state archive. A detailed identification of all the documents hitherto singled out as"accounts"was carried out.

The collection contains personal files and various financial documents: bills that arrived to (concentration) camps, and which relate to the consumption of goods in the camps, orders for shoes, slippers, wood, food and clothing, lists of dead prisoners, documents relating to the sending of packages to inmates, list of people coming into camps. Preserved are reports from the field and reports on detainees, by day.
