Ernest was born in Cöln (Cologne), Germany on 15 July 1903 to Karl (Carl) and Amalie Meijer. Lotte was born in Stuttgart, Germany on 26 September 1908 to Julius and Margaret (née Kann). In 1933, Lotte and Ernest left Germany for the Netherlands before the war. They were married at a synagogue in Amsterdam in 1937. Following Germany’s invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Bob went into hiding living with another married couple until after liberation in 1945. Ernst and Lotte lived in hiding with a doctor’s family. At age 6, he was reunited with them and they eventually immigrated to the U.S. in 1948 and stayed in New York for a short time. They settled in Denver, Colorado, and had another son, Tom. Ernest and Lotte became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1953.

The Meyer family collection consists of documents, photocopies, social reports, and a photograph illustrating the experiences of Lotte (née Weil), Ernest (Ernst Meijer), and Bob Meyer (b. 1939) during the Holocaust in the Netherlands and their subsequent immigration to the U.S. in 1948. Original U.S. Naturalization Certificates for Ernest and Lotte Meyer conferred on 4 May 1953 are included as well as restitution claims, a medical evaluation regarding Lotte Meyer, and a social worker report regarding Bob Meyer that requests recognition and assistance as a victim of persecution under the Netherlands' Act on Benefits for Victims of Persecution 1940-1945 (WUV).
