Ety Rosinski-Moncarz was hidden in a convent in Ardennes, Belgium, for a period of time and used the name "Nelly Du Frane." She also hid with her mother for awhile once she left the convent.

The collection consists of four photographs relating to the experiences of Ety Rosinski-Moncarz during the Holocaust. Several of the photographs depicts Ety and other girls at a convent preparing for their first communion, and one photograph shows Ety walking along a street in Binche, Belgium, with her aunt, Betty Szyper, and her cousin, Albert Szyper.
