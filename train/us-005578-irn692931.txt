The poster was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

One-sheet poster for the 1952 re-release of the film, “The Mad Lover,” originally released as “Enemy of Women” in November 1944. The film begins in 1925, and shows a fictionalized account of a young Paul Joseph Goebbels as he rises through the ranks of the Nazi party. He becomes the Minister of Propaganda, earns a reputation as a womanizer, and exacts revenge on a woman who scorns his attention. The film was produced by W.R. Frank, the owner of a theater chain in Minneapolis, and directed by Alfred Zeisler, a German expatriate who claimed to have worked on propaganda films with Goebbels himself. The film focuses on Goebbels’s character and personal life, addressing his abuse of political position and power to his own advantage. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
