First public NS student rally in Vienna

Excerpt from newsreel Ostmark-Wochenschau Nr. 13/1938 (25. März 1938) about the first NS student public rally after the five-year ban. Title card: “Vienna | First National Socialist Student Rally.” Main building of the University of Vienna, with Nazi flags flying from its balconies and draped from its columns. On the steps, a large crowd of students is gathered. Nazi flag waving in the wind. Students in front of the building. Rows of students march through the larger crowd, which is enormous by now. They appear to be mostly, if not all, men. Men wearing long coats and Nazi armbands march up the steps. Hubert Klausner and Josef Burckel walk up the steps between two crowds of students. CU on a young man in Nazi uniform, giving the salute and singing. Various shots of the crowd giving the Nazi salute and singing. Klausner and Burckel exit the building, walking down the steps between the students and saluting. Rows of Nazi soldiers march past the building. Klausner in his car; he salutes as it drives away.
