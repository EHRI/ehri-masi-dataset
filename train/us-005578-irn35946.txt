K치roly Verebes (1920-1987) was a Hungarian actor who worked in forced-labor battalions during World War II. He was married to Hungarian actress Eva Schubert, and had two children, Dora Verebes and Stephen Verebes.

The collection consists of the memoir of K치roly Verebes (1920-1987), a Hungarian actor who worked almost continuously in forced labor battalions during World War II. Mr. Verebes was only able to complete a first draft of his memoirs; however, the wartime chapter is complete. Also includes deposit receipts and wartime postcards and letters written to family and friends about his thoughts, feelings, and experiences while working in the Jewish labor battalions. The majority of correspondence is with S치ndor Gelb, who was likely a relative.
