Consists of the family history of the Dratcu (Dratwa) family, originally of Hotin (Chotyn), Romania, written by Dr. Luiz Dratcu in 2005. In the history, Dr. Dratcu describes his family's experiences on a forced march from Hotin into Russia and how his father, David, and uncle, Ephraim, managed to escape from the march. They were imprisoned in the Popowitz labor camp in Transnistria, but Ephraim managed to escape to Palestine. David was liberated by the Soviet Army, which he then joined for the remainder of the war. After the war, the family reunited, and by 1952, were all living in Brazil. Includes two photographs of David Dratcu in his Soviet uniform; one of the photos also includes his younger brother, Tudor.
