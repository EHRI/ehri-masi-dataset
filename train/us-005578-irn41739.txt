Consists of one memoir, 50 pages, entitled "S端ssholz Siblings: The War" by Friedl S端ssholz-Wolfstein, originally of Trier, Germany. She describes her childhood, her father and brother's deportation from Germany as stateless persons in 1938, and her own escape as a child into Belgium, where her family was slowly reunited. After various attempts to escape after the outbreak of war, Friedl and her brothers were arrested in France, and Friedl was deported to Auschwitz, where she worked sorting victim belongings in the "Canada" section of the camp. After Auschwitz was evacuated, Friedl was sent first to Ravensbr端ck and then to Malchow, and was liberated by the American army. She returned to Belgium and reunited with her brothers and mother, married, and illegally immigrated to Palestine. The story of their immigration is told in I.F. Stone's book "Underground to Palestine", in which Friedl is mentioned.
