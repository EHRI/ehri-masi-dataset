Leon Ilutovich was born on April 8, 1914 in Odessa, Russia to Jankiel and Lea (née Plotycher). He graduated from the University of Poland in 1932 and earned a law degree from Warsaw University in 1937. While he lived in Warsaw, Ilutovich was active in the Zionist movement. After the German invasion of Poland, he fled Warsaw and made his way by foot through the forests to Vilna, Lithuania leaving behind his parents and extended family. After the Soviet Union annexed Lithuania, Ilutovich decided to flee Vilna as well and obtained Curacao and Japanese visas from Zwartendijk and Sugihara. Leon was number 819 on Sugihara’s list, his wife Maria was number 720. While in Japan he became a representative of the Jewish Agency and a secretary of the World Jewish Congress. Most of Ilutovich’s family perished. In 1941, Leon traveled to Shanghai, China to establish the “Far Eastern Committee representing the Jewish Agency for Palestine in connections with the immigration of Jewish refugees stranded in the Far East.” In July 1941, he served as member of the Palestine Committee and was one of four representatives of the Jewish agency for Japan. He was hospitalized with typhus from October 16 through November 21, 1943. From November to February 1945, Leon served as the manager and general manager of the Jewish Weekly publication Our Life. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of Polish War Refugees in Shanghai. From 1945 to 1946, he worked as the Secretary of the World Jewish Congress in China. He served as a delegate from China to the 22nd Zionist Congress held in Basel, Switzerland on December 9, 1946. By 1948, he moved to New York and worked as an American correspondent for The Voice of Zionism, a Jewish-Hebrew weekly publication. In the United States he later serve as the Assistant Director of the Palestine Bureau, the Director and Editor of the Zionist Information Service, and the Assistant Executive Director of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA). He also served as a member of the Zionist Actions Committee and served as Secretary of the ZOA delegation to the 24th, 25th, 27th, 28th, and 29th Congresses held in Jerusalem. At some point he married Rebeka Ilutovich (born Renia Lindenbaum), who was likely among his acquaintances from Warsaw, Poland.

Before the war, Renia Lindenbaum (b. 1917, later Renia Landau and Rebeka Ilutovich) was active in the “Ha ‘Noar Ha’Zioni” Zionist youth organization, where she met her future husband Michal (Mulek) Landau and likely her second husband Leon Ilutovich. In July 1940, Michal Landau escaped the Łódź ghetto and found his way to the Warsaw ghetto where he was reunited with Renia. Shortly after his arrival in the Warsaw ghetto he and Renia contracted typhus. Both recovered and on November 9, 1941 they were married in a rabbi’s study. It was a traditional Jewish wedding. Renia wore her sister Sara Kuniegis’ wedding dress and they served carrot cake. In February 1943, Renia and Michal escaped the Warsaw ghetto. Renia hid with her brother Lutek and her sister-in-law Rutka. However, after a few weeks Mr. Czechorowski took the three of them to an open field and abandoned them. Despite attempts to persuade her to stay, Renia decided to leave Lutek and Rutka in order to find her husband who was hidden elsewhere. Soon after Renia left, Lutek and Rutka were discovered and executed by the Gestapo. Renia found Michal and together they hid in a coal pit for a couple of weeks before making their way to the Hotel Polski. There they obtained Palestinian certificates. In 1943, they were deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In April 1945, the prisoners were forced aboard a train and traveled without food for several days. The train was abandoned by German soldiers outside of Magdeburg, Germany and American forces liberated the prisoners the following day. The survivors were taken to the Hillers Leben village where they were able to recuperate. Renia and Michal were among the survivors. In September 1945, after spending a month in Belgium, Renia and Michal arrived in Palestine aboard the British military ship “Mataroa.” Eventually Renia Landau married Leon Ilutovich. During her life Renia also went by the name Rebeka.
