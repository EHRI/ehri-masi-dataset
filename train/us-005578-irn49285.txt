Theodor Heilborn was born on September 8, 1883 in Berlin, Germany, to Siegfried and Jenny Cohn Heilborn. Recha Bloch was born in 1887 to Kato and Lea Bloch in Bosatz bei Ratibor, Prussia [now Racibórz, Poland]. Theodor passed the bar exam in 1906 and was appointed a deputy justice in Berlin in 1910. Theodor and Recha married in 1923. In 1926, Recha gave birth to their only child, Vera Beate Heilborn. In 1933 when the Nazis took power, Theodor was removed from his position as an attorney and notary. He began to collect family history documentation establishing the family’s long ties to Germany and, possibly, in preparation for emigration. The family was able to immigrate to the United States, arriving in May 1940. Vera entered high school in Gloversville, NY, in 1940. She met Harold Fassberg, who was born in 1919 in East Palestine, OH, when she was tutoring him in German. Harold later became a member of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, writing to Vera while he was stationed overseas. Harold is credited by Gitta Sereny with locating and capturing Albert Speer. Vera and Harold married in July 1946 and had five children: Roseanne (b. 1950); Linda (b. 1952); Steven (b. 1956); Lois (b. 1959); and Marlene (b. 1961). Theodor Heilborn passed away in July 1969; Recha Heilborn passed away in August 1972. Harold Fassberg passed away in 1999; Vera Fassberg passed away in 2001.

Consists of documents, correspondence, and a family tree related to the family of Theodor and Recha Bloch Heilborn, originally of Berlin, Germany. Includes family documentation from Germany from 1840-1939, documentation regarding Theodor Heilborn's career as an attorney, being stripped of his position in 1933, and the family's emigration documentation. Also includes extensive correspondence between the Heilborns' only child, Vera, and Harold Fassberg, a member of the American military during World War II, in 1945-1946, while Harold was serving as a member of the strategic bombing survey group. Fassberg is credited with the location and capture of Albert Speer. Vera Heilborn and Harold Fassberg later married. This collection consists of extensive family tree information and copies of birth, marriage, and death certificates from members of the Heilborn and Bloch families from 1840-1930, including original documentation and copies of documentation collected in the 1930s. Also includes wartime documentation related to Theodor Heilborn being removed from his position as an attorney, the family’s Reisepasses, and the document announcing they would have to take the middle names of “Israel” and “Sara.” The collection also contains extensive correspondence between Vera Heilborn and Harold Fassberg, mainly from Vera, in 1945-1946, as Harold is traveling throughout Europe and the United States at the end of the war. Harold’s military records from the end of 1945 are included, but are mainly military orders and do not mention his participation in the search for Albert Speer.
