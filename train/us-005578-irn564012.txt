Isaac Mevorah (1917-2005) was born on 10 January 1917 to Yom Tov Mevorah and Doudoun Altcheh (1878-1943) in Salonika, Greece. He had two older siblings, a sister Julie Mano (1914-1943) and a brother Vital (1915-1944). Isaac's mother Doudoun descended from a family of Turkish origin and was a teacher. His father Yom Tov owned a prosperous leather factory and died prior to the war. After the German invasion of Salonika in 1941 the local Jewish community faced antisemitic strictures and ghettoization. Isaac was sent to forced labor in Thebes in January 1943 while his loved ones were interned in the ghetto in the Baron Hirsch district. In March 1943 the Mevorahs, including Julie's child, were deported together to Auschwitz. Doudoun, Julie, and the child were killed upon arrival, while Isaac and Vital were selected for forced labor. From April to July 1944 Isaac was forced to work in an electrical kommando at Auschwitz III. He was later transported to Warsaw and imprisoned at Dachau. In August 1944 Isaac was hospitalized at Mühldorf, a sub-camp of Dachau. He remained in Mühldorf until liberation in April 1945. For several months after his release Isaac lived in the Feldafing displaced persons camp. There he met fellow survivor Stamo Battino (1925-2006). The couple married in 1946 and returned to Greece with members of Stamo's family. In 1951 Isaac and Stamo immigrated to the United States on board the SS Independence. They later settled in New York and raised a family.

Consists of discharge papers documenting Isaac Mevorah's release from Dachau in 1945 and a photograph of a Maccabi soccer team in Salonika, Greece circa 1936.
