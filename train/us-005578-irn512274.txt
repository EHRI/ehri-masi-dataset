Matilda Kovačević (later Matilda Cigic) was born in Valpovo, Slavonia, Croatia to Pavao and Katarina (née Bader) Kovačević. Her family was Christian and she had six siblings: Petar, Franjo, Ana, Katarina, Marija, and Dragutin. Her father was a Communist and after the German occupation of Yugoslavia he was involved in partisan activities against the Ustaša in the newly created Independent State of Croatia. The family hid several Jews in the barn on their property, including Jakša Singer, Zdenko Has, and Adam Štajnbrikner. The family were all involved in partisan activities, and routinely faced harassment and searches by the Ustaša. After the war they learned that Katarina’s mother was supportive of Ustaša and had reported on the family. Matilda’s brother Peter was killed in a partisan battle. On 2 May 2001 the Kovačević family was recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations.
