The Florian de la Comble collection consists of a photocopy of a map dictated by M. Jean Simon and drawn by Colonel Florian de la Comble of the route used by Banyuls people to assist refugees into Spain. Also includes three large copyprints of photographs: one of an image from the top of a mountain in the Pyrenees showing a beachfront town below; one of the train station in Banyuls-sur-Mer (undated, possibly 1930s) with the town in the background; and one of the plaza in front of the train station with four people and a horse-drawn cart (undated).
