Szloma Kleiner was born on September 15, 1918, in lazy, Poland. His father, Hersz-Lejb Kleiner, was a tailor, and his mother, Mala Dresner Kleiner, took care of the children. Szloma had four siblings: Abram-Zelig (1914-1943), Mendel Ajzik (1916-1943), Cesia, (1923-ca.1943), and Doba (b.1926). Hersz-Lejb and Mala Kleiner, were deported to Auschwitz on August 26, 1943, and were killed on arrival. In November 1940, the Germans arrested Szloma and sent him to a series of camps including Flossenbürg, Borki Wielki, Gröditz, and a sub-camp of Gross Rosen. On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated Szloma Kleiner, and he immediately returned to his hometown of lazy and Sosnowiec, Poland, to search for his family. When he realized that everyone but his sister, Doba, perished, he left Poland for Bergen-Belsen DP camp On August 31, 1947, he immigrated to Sweden, and two years later, on May 29, 1949, he married Nacha Weisfuss. Nacha Weisfuss Kleiner was born on May 6, 1918, in Sosnowiec. In 1941 she was deported to Flossing labor camp and later transferred to Peterswaldau labor camp. She was liberated on May 8, 1945, by the Soviet Army.
