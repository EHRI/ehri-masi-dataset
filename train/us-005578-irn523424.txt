Three-page typed letter, with blank envelope, written by a pilot who flew reporter Percy Knauth and photographers Marguerite Higgins, Margaret Bourke-White, and Lee Miller to the Buchenwald concentration camp in April 1945. The letter describes their arrival at the camp and the conditions they found there. The mission was supposed to be piloted by U.S. Air Force First Lieutenant Regis Gignoux [donor's father], but his C.O. chose to fly the mission himself. The collection also includes three photographs taken in Buchenwald concentration camp immediately following liberation; dated April-May 1945.
