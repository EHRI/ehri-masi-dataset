Consists of letters, dated between August 21, 1939 and March 14, 1940, from family members Paul, Herman, and Clara, to Martha, who had escaped from Czechoslovakia to Palestine with her family. In the letters, the family (likely siblings) inform Martha of their imprisonment, fears, and the increasing German persecution, as well as their inability to escape. Clara, who was Martha's sister, sent her letters from St. Nazaire, France, and while Herman and Paul's letters do not include a location, Herman was likely writing from Prague, while Paul was imprisoned in an unnamed camp. Also includes one letter from brother Hans to Martha, written from Jerusalem on March 10, 1941, inquiring whether she has heard from their family still in Europe.
