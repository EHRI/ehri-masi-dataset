Rose Ianni (born Rose Goldberg) is the daughter of Bruno and Fradjla (Kamelgarn) Goldberg. She was born on August 2, 1930 in Metz, France, where Bruno was a carpenter and cabinetmaker. Her parents had moved to Metz from Poland in the 1920s. The family left Metz in 1940 following the German invasion and went to Laval. They remained there through July 14, 1942, the day of the grand raffle, when the local Jewish population was rounded-up for deportation. During the round-up Rose and her parents were taken to a large enclosure. Rose was held there for one day and then released because she was under the age of twelve. Her parents, however, were deported to Auschwitz, where they perished. After her release, Rose went to live with elderly relatives in Laval. She stayed with them until September 1942, when she fled to cousins in Lyons. From Lyons, Rose went into hiding with a cousin in a farmhouse in the village of Pasin near Grenoble. She remained in Pasin until the liberation. After the war Rose was hospitalized in Lyon for over six months. Upon her release, she moved into the Le Tremplin OSE home in St. Genis-Laval. The following year she moved to an all-girls home in St. Germain-en-Laye. When David Kamelgarn, an uncle living in America, heard that she had survived, he sponsored her immigration to the United States. Rose sailed from Le Harvre in July 1947.
