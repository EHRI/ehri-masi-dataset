The establishment of Polish-German diplomatic relations took place in November 1918, and the function of an unofficial diplomatic representation was in place beginning in December 1918, through the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Berlin. Soon, under the pressure of the Entente countries, diplomatic relations were suspended and Polish interests in Germany were represented by the Danish embassy in Berlin. This situation lasted until the signing of a peace treaty in Versailles, and soon after this, representation of Polish interests was again taken over by the Consulate General of Poland in Berlin. The re-establishment of diplomatic relations and the establishment of the Republic of Poland took place in the beginning of 1920. The elevation of the Polish Embassy in Berlin to the rank of Embassy of the Republic of Poland took place in October 1934. The facility was in operation until the beginning of September 1939.
