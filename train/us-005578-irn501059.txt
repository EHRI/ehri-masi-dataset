Testimony, 444 pages, typescript, titled "My Sisters, My Brothers," by Seren Bernstein (Tuvel), with Louise Loots Thornton, of Aptos, CA, in 1980. Thornton, after learning of Bernstein's experiences through her son, started interviewing her and wrote this manuscript as a novelized form of memoir based on those interviews. Includes detailed descriptions of Bernstein's childhood in a village in Transylvania, forced labor in Budapest, death march, and deportation to Ravensbr√ºck. The manuscript was subsequently published as "The Seamstress: A Memoir of Survival," by Sara Tuvel Bernstein (Putnam: 1997).
