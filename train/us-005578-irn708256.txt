Edith Simon Babich (1922-2005) was born in Cloppenburg to Karl (1884-1943) and Selma (née Katz, 1894-1943) Simon. Her father was a cattle merchant, and she had three sisters: Ruth, Hildegard, and Ilse. During Kristallnacht in November 1938 Karl and his cousin Julius Frank were arrested and deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. They were released a month later. While they were still in the concentration camp, Edith’s sisters Ruth and Hildegard were sent on a Kindertransport to England. In May 1939 Karl, Selma, Edith, and Ilse sailed from Germany to Havana, Cuba, aboard the MS St. Louis. After the ship's forced return to Europe, Edith's parents sent her to England in August 1939. She immigrated to the United States from England in 1940 and eventually settled in Illinois in 1941. Karl, Selma, and Ilse, were deported to the Westerbork concentration camp and in 1943 they were deported to the Sobibor killing center, where they perished. Edith married Reuben Babich, a United States Army soldier, in 1945.
