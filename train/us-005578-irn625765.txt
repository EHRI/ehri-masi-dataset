Ervin Sax and his wife Gabriella were forced to flee Czechoslovakia in 1939. Knowing that the journey could be difficult and dangerous, they left their sixth-year-old daughter Yehudit with her grandparents, thinking that the Nazis would not harm the elderly. When they arrived in Palestine in 1939, Ervin joined the British army as a chaplain (apparently in the role of rabbi) and was taken into German captivity. Gabriella remained in Palestine when the war broke out in Europe.Yehudit was deported to Theresienstadt and murdered there in 1942.

Collection of correspondence between Ervin Sax, a Jewish soldier in the British Army, who was captured by the Germans and held in Stalag VIIIB as a British POW, and his wife Gabriella in Palestine. Several letters concern the attempts by both to work with Mandate authorities to secure their house in Czechoslovakia. Several letters were facilitated through the Red Cross.
