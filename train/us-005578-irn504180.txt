Sigbert Dingfelder (1891-1978) was born Neustadt an der Aisch in Bavaria, Germany to Emma (née Gunderheimer, b. 1865) and August Dingfelder (b. 1862). He had one brother, Herman (1897-1977), and two sisters, Hermine (b. 1895) and Rosa. Sigbert was in the German Army during World War I, and later became a textile engineer. He married Elizabeth Neu, and they lived in Nürnberg, Germany where they had one son, Justin (b. 1936). Sigbert was briefly imprisoned in Dachau concentration camp in 1938, and in 1939 he, Elizabeth, and Justin immigrated to the United States, settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His brother, Herman, and his sister, Rosa, also immigrated to the United States. His mother, Emma, his father, August, and his sister, Hermine were all interned at Theresienstadt concentration camp. August died in the camp, but everyone else survived and immigrated to the United States. Elizabeth Dingfelder (née Neu, b. 1905) was born in Fürth, Germany to Florentine (née Nathan, b. 1875) and Siegfried Neu (1864-1959). Her parents were both living in Nürnberg when they were sent to Theresienstadt around 1941. Her mother was killed in an unidentified concentration camp, but her father survived and immigrated to the United States.
