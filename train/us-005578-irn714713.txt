The Anti-Communist Social Committee (Antyk) (or "Akcja" Antyk ') was a sub-department formed in November 1943 by the Information and Propaganda Bureau of the Home Army (BiP AK). The main goal of the Anti-Communist Committee was counter propaganda, showing the communist propaganda, the real face of the Soviet system and the true intentions of the USSR towards Poland. Anti-communist information was disseminated in newspapers ("Głos Ludu", "Wolność Robotnicza"), brochures and leaflets issued by the Committee. "Antyk" operated for 9 months, ended its activity at the end of July 1944, at the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising.
