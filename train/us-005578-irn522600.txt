Ben Giladi (1925-2012) was born in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland. Following the German invasion in 1939, he spent his adolescent years in the Piotrków ghetto, working in a glass factory. When the ghetto was dissolved, he was deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp, and later, to Dora-Mittelbau. He was liberated in Nordhausen in April 1945, and returned to Poland, studying at the University of Łódź, before immigrating to Israel in 1950. There he married Guta (Tova) Flatto, also a native of Piotrków, and in 1959 the Giladis immigrated to the United States, settling in Kew Gardens, New York. Ben Giladi was the longtime editor of several newsletter publications of the Piotrków Trybunalski Survivors Association, as well as the editor of the book "A Tale of One City: Piotrków Trybunalski" (New York: Shengold Publications, 1991).

The collection consists of 49 photographs and a scrapbook of photographs pertaining to Ben Giladi's family and friends in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland. The scrapbook also contains photographs and text that Giladi assembled while editor of the "New Bulletin-The Voice of Piotrków Survivors."
