The poster was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

Poster for the American feature film “Four Sons,” released by 20th Century-Fox in June 1940. The film was a remake of a 1928 film by the same name, set in Bavaria before and during World War I. The 1940 remake was set during the late 1930s in the Czechoslovakian region along the German border known as the Sudetenland. It focuses on a mother and her four sons, who have divided political loyalties. One son enlists in the Czech army and clashes with his brother who joins the Nazis. A third brother is drafted by the German army after the Sudetenland was annexed in 1938, while the fourth brother, an artist, escapes the same fate by immigrating to the United States. Three of the four brothers are killed as a result of the war, and the mother, her daughter-in-law, and grandson set out to immigrate to the United States. Advertising for “Four Sons” was the first to use imagery of the “specter of death,” a common theme of interventionist political cartoons and editorials. This led to threats on the studio from the German consul-general. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
