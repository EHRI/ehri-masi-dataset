Correspondence with Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)

42 letters

The (DFG) is the major German reseach funding organisation. Its members are universities and other approved research institutions. The self-governed organisation was (re)founded in 1949 and is financed by the German states as well as the Federal government.

The correspondence centres on two major issues concerning a) the exchange of the institutionâ€™s own publications, and b) the options for financial and political support of the Library by gathering a board-like circle of influential individuals in (West) Germany (1963).
