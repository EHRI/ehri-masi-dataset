Bernard (Berish) Gurtman (1905-1983) was born in Chorostków, Poland (now Khorostkiv, Ukraine) to Aharon and Miriam Gurman. Paula Gurtman (1918-2012) was born in Stryj, Poland (now Stryi, Ukraine) to Chaim and Taube Hammer. Paula survived the Holocaust in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. She met and married Berish at Kibbutz Hatikvah at the Hofgeismar displaced persons camp in Germany in 1946. They moved to Badgastein in November 1946 to rejoin Berish’s brother, and in November 1947 they were transferred to an empty military camp somewhere between Badgastein and Salzburg. They later immigrated to the United States.

The collection consists of six photographs depicting Berish and Paula Gurtman and other refugees in Kibbutz Hatikvah in Hofgeismar, Germany, and in a displaced persons camp in Badgastein, Austria, after World War II.
