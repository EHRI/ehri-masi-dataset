The Pennsylvania journal, or, Weekly advertiser, Number 1524, September 11, 1782

The newspaper was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2016 by the Katz Family.

The Katz Ehrenthal Collection is a collection of more than 900 objects depicting Jews and antisemitic and anti-Jewish propaganda from the medieval to the modern era, in Europe, Russia, and the United States. The collection was amassed by Peter Ehrenthal, a Romanian Holocaust survivor, to document the pervasive history of anti-Jewish hatred in Western art, politics and popular culture. It includes crude folk art as well as pieces created by Europe's finest craftsmen, prints and periodical illustrations, posters, paintings, decorative art, and toys and everyday household items decorated with depictions of stereotypical Jewish figures.

This newspaper is one of more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of antisemitic visual materials.
