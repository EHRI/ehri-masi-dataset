The collection includes a diary written by Ilona Braunstein Korach in 1945, documenting her experiences in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland and Buchenwald concentration camp sub-camps Gelsenkirchen and Sömmerda. The diary was created by Livia Klein with whom Ilona and her daughter Martha were in camp with. The front cover of the diary states "Ilu [Ilona] Béla [Ilona’s husband who perished] and Marti” and the back states “minden elmulik egyszer” ("this too shall pass").
