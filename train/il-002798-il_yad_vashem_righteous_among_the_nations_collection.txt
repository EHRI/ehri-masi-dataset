24,811 rescuers; among them were 1,665 Belgian rescuers.

The files concern rescuers recognized as Righteous Among the Nations and honoured by Yad Vashem. It is only an indication of the actual number of rescuers, since it is based on the cases brought to the attention of Yad Vashem. Most Righteous were recognised thanks to the requests made by rescued Jews. By January 1st 2014, there were 1665 files of Belgian rescuers. There is a file for every rescue case, containing the documents gathered through the process of recognition. One will find correspondence, notes, sometimes photographs, and material related to the recognition ceremonies.
