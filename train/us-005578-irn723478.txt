The Private Hebrew Teachers Seminary “Tarbut” in Wilno, Poland was founded in 1921 and was part of a network of educational institutions established by the Tarbut movement in Poland. The movement's primary objective was to prepare Jewish youth for settlement in Palestine. The Tarbut program was a synthesis of the Polish school system and the curriculum followed by Zionist schools in Palestine. Hebrew was the language of instruction and the curriculum included biblical and talmudic literature and Jewish cultural traditions. Courses in agriculture and natural sciences were introduced to teach the sudents to deal with practical problems in Palestine. Teachers' seminaries were created to train Tarbut teachers for the Hebrew elementary school system. The seminaries were established in Vilna, Grodno, Warsaw and Lvov. The Vilna seminary existed until about 1940.[Source: Guide to the YIVO Archives]
