Le P. Hecht au cardinal Maglione

Unavailable.

Hecht, charged by Raphaelsverein, informs Maglione that a person from Prague, now living in Bordighera (Italy), is fraudulently selling Brazilian emigration visas, even to non-Catholics and non-Baptised. Dall'Acqua says that he spoke with Mr Dutra, secretary of the Brazilian embassy, who declared that that person is unknown by the embassy. Tardini suggests to inform both the Brazilian embassy and the Raphaelsverein about the forgery.
