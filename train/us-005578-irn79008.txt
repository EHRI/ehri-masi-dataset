Cecilie Radó (née Engländer) was born in Jekelfalva, Hungary (Austro-Hungarian Empire) on 25 January 1894. During the years of the Horthy regime, her husband, Ignác Radó, chose to immigrate to the United States, while Cecilie stayed behind in Budapest, not wanting to give up her apartment there. During the German occupation of Hungary, she was issued a protective pass ("Schutz-Pass") by the Royal Swedish Legation in Budapest, under the direction of Raoul Wallenberg, and survived the war.

One protective pass ("Schutz-Pass") issued by the Royal Swedish Legation in Budapest, for Cecilie Radó, on 26 August 1944. The pass asserts that the above-named person is protected by the Royal Swedish Legation, and has the right to travel to Sweden under the terms of repatriation authorized by the Swedish Foreign Ministry. The pass contains stamps and a signature from the staff of the legation, but is missing the photograph of Radó.
