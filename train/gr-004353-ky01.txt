Αρχείο της Κεντρικής Υπηρεσίας, 1941-1946

434 files.

During the German Occupation (1941-1944) the operation of the Foreign Ministry, and by extension of all its Services, was suspended, and access to the archives was strictly forbidden. After the liberation of Greece the record groups were in complete disarray: it became clear that the collection had been partly ransacked and selectively destroyed. Some of the files had been carried off when the Occupation forces departed for Germany, while a number of documents had been removed and destroyed, as was evident from the gaps found in the chronological sequence of the record groups when they were returned in sacks by the American army. The task of reclassifying the archives began in 1945 and was completed five years later.

Reports on the Greek population and the general conditions under the German, Bulgarian and Italian Occupation. Famine, oppression, deportation of Jews, massacres, executions, political, social, educational measures, the issues of the Jewish properties, Jewish immigration to Palestine.
