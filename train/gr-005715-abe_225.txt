The tobacco firm Aron I. Tsimino and Cie was found in Kavala in 1919.

This collection holds the archives of a Jewish family's company that exported tobacco from the port of Kavala. This company was the only large Jewish company in post-war Kavala. The family that led the company also donated its family archives from the Holocaust period and documents pertaining to the family's attempts at restitution after the Holocaust.
