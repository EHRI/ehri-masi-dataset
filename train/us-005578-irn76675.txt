The Teatrul Baraşeum and Elly Roman collection consists of an annotated business card, photographs, clippings, flyers, musical scores, and programs documenting Elly Roman’s work with the Teatrul Baraşeum in Bucharest during World War II, musical reviews, and performances of “Ce faci asta seara?” and “Ce faci dupa masa?” The Teatrul Baraşeum was a theater operated in Bucharest from 1941 to 1944 by a group of Jewish artists banned from Romanian cultural institutions under racist legislation during General Ion Antonescu’s administration. Performances were allowed only in Romanian under Antonescu, but Yiddish performances began following his overthrow. The Baraşeum was succeeded by the State Jewish Theater (Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat) under the communist regime. Elly Roman (1905-1996) was a Romanian composer whose works were performed at the Baraşeum.
