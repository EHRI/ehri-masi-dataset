These Special Forces should be recognizable by their swastika arm-ties. They were instructed to fight day and night.

The attack was initiated by heavy artillery fire, forcing the Americans out of their outposts. Using artificial fog, German troops (battalions of the 212th Volksgrenadier division) then crossed the river in dinghies (around 10 men per boat). Upon docking on the side of the river, German troops then had to cross minefields. Although many lost their life the reinforcement was able to continue the attack on Esternach and Berdorf, leading to melee combat. American counterattacks are in progress. The preparations for this attack were overall very secretive. It was not until the very evening before that the regimentâ€™s commandeur made his announcement to the troops. As a security measure troops then had to hand in flashlights, matches and candles as the operation called for complete darkness. The troops knew how serious the situation at hand was, was they were only instructed to carry ammunition and rations for two days, leaving behind gas masks and some weaponry. All this was part of the plan for the big offensive. The troops were told to fight day and night, and to not stop until they reached the Spanish Pyrenees.
