The Nash (also 'Nasch') family originally came from Holesov, Czech Republic, where they had been living since the 16th century. Eric Nash (born in 1910) grew up in a well-to-do family who owned a wholesale grain business. The family moved to Vienna in 1918 following an anti-Jewish pogrom in his home town Holesov when their house was raided. In 1936 he moved to Brno, Czech Republic, after completing his medical studies in Vienna.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Although he and his brother had the opportunity to leave the country to escape the oppression from the occupying Nazi German regime they chose to stay as their mother was unable to make the trip and they believed that the war would soon be over. In 1941 his brother Willi (born in 1901), a successful lawyer, and his wife Doris Fantl were taken on the first transport from Brno to Minsk, Russia, where Doris died a year later due to illness. Willi was executed in 1943.</div><br /><div>In 1942 Eric Nash and his wife Erna, his mother Irma, his sister Trude and her husband Henry were deported from Brno to Terezin ghetto where the family survived for two and a half years.
