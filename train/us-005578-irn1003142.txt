"Resurrection...Meditation" [Narration indicates this is Dachau - to be verified.] Survivors, delousing (re-clothed). Men climbing into truck, driving on road. Released. Some men still wear striped caps. Line of military tanks. Many German civilians walking along road (tracking shots), some hiding faces [USHMM collection contains color still images of this scene]. Great numbers of German civilians in central courtyard at Buchenwald. Shots of survivors behind barbed wire. CUs, wounded feet. Germans viewing display on tables. Pan, lampshade, skin, etc. Fainted women. Mass funeral, prayer at graveside with priest, rabbi, chaplain. Good shots of mourners. Wooden coffins, civilian passers-by, void of expression. Open coffins in row. Children. German men in hats carry open coffin on cobblestone street.
