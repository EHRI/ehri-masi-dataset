Grigorijaus Šuro dienoraštis, rašytas Vilniaus gete ir „Kailio“ stovykloje 1941–1944 m.

13 notebooks, 1 notepad and over 300 pages of manuscript of various paper sizes.

The fact that Schur's manuscripts were saved was largely thanks to the Lithuanian librarian Ona Šimaitė. She smuggled his 39 notebooks out of the ghetto at the risk of her life and hid them in the floor of the University Library in Vilnius. After the war, Ona Schimaite from France informed the newly founded Jewish Museum in Vilnius about the hiding place of the documents, which disappeared after its dissolution in 1949 in the Museum of the History of the Revolution. A museum employee secretly prepared a typescript for the surviving daughter Miriam, who emigrated to Israel with her husband in 1960. Together with Vladimir Porudominsky, Schur's nephew, they succeeded after many unsuccessful attempts to publish the records in the Netherlands and Germany.

Grigory Schur was born in November 1888 in Vilnius. He and his wife Olga had two children. He worked as an editor for various newspapers and owned an electrics shop. After the German Army took over in 1941, the family was forced to move into the Vilnius ghetto. Grigory Schur was forced to work in a fur-processing factory. He was transferred to the Concentration Camp Stutthof shortly before the ghetto was liberated. Grigory Schur died there in 1944 under unknown circumstances. He was 55 years old.

The notes of Grigory Shur (1888 Vilnius - 1944 Stutthof concentration camp) written in the Vilna Ghetto and in the Kailis forced labour camp contain records of the actions of the Nazis in the Vilna Ghetto and the system of massacres in Paneriai.  Describing "actions", mass murders, the gradual annihilation of the Jewish population, but also collaboration and cruelty within the ghetto and the ghetto police. The records are dated, but the date often indicates the time of the event rather than the time when the record was made.
