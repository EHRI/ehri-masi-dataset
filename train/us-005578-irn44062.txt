Manfred Greiffenhagen (20 July 1896, Berlin - 19 January 1945, Dachau) was a writer and cabaret author, best known for his work while interned at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. It was there that he wrote songs for the cabaret performances in the camp, and was later forced to work on a propaganda film created by the authorities at the camp titled "Theresienstadt: Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet." This film was also known as "Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt," and was intended to portray Theresienstadt in a positive light. Greiffenhagen was subsequently deported to Auschwitz in 1944, and later to Dachau, where he died in January 1945. (Source: Wikipedia article, http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Greiffenhagen).
