Good, William Z.

William Good, formerly Vovka Gdud, was born in the village of Stolpce, Poland, on 24 Apr. 1924. He later moved with his family to Niemenzyzn, Poland, near Wilno. He was educated in various Jewish schools in the area of Wilno, Poland (Vilnius, Lithuania). His mother and brother were killed by the Russians during the Holocaust. Good and his father survived by hiding in the forests and in the homes of non-Jewish Poles.

Consists of a copy of a survivor testimony entitled "From 'Jerusalayim d'Lita' and back (Wilno, 'Jerusalem of Lithuania')" written by William Z. Good. The testimony describes Good's experience as a child in Niemenczyn, Soviet Union; persecution by Poles; his narrow escape from an execution in Ponary; hiding in the forest and in the homes of Poles during the Holocaust; and his return to Wilno, Poland (Vilnius, Lithuania) and Niemenczyn after 43 years. Also included are several photocopies of Gdud family photographs through the years and an article from a Russian-language newspaper in Vilnius, Lithuania, concerning his return to Wilno. The article is accompanied by an English translation.
