Nazi propaganda film about people with disabilities: interiors of a hospital

Reel 7 of 8: "Koepfe von Kranken" More CUs and dramatic lighting. Focus on details. First men, then women. Distorted faces. Woman with wild gray hair, very touching. 00:43:21 Dark-haired woman, then a girl, maybe Jewish. Force feeding a young person.
