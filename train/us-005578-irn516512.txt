Annelies Sabatowski (1927-1943) was born on October 20, 19127 in Dresden, Germany to Isidor (Izidor, 1897-1943) and Jetka (Jeti) Sabatowski (1903-1943). She and her parents perished at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in March 1943.

The Annelies Sabatowski letters were written by Annelies Sabatowski, originally of Dresden, Germany, on December 30, 1938, and March 6, 1939, to "Gisa" (Gisela "Gisa" Kleinermann, now Goldstein). In the letters, Annelies, a fifth-grade pupil at the Jewish school in Dresden, writes that classes were cancelled for a few months after Kristallnacht, and that she is hoping to be on a transport to England. Annelies and her family (with the exception of a brother, Fritz) were deported to Auschwitz and killed in 1943.
