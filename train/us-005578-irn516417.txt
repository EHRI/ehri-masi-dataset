Consists of one memoir, undated, entitled, "Alberto Cernogoraz; 1914-1946: Holocaust Survivor," by Genoveffa Cernogoraz Cook. Mrs. Cook writes about her childhood in pre-war and wartime Italy and her memories of her brother, Alberto, who was arrested in 1943 as a member of the Italian Underground and was presumed dead. After the war, however, the family learned that he had been imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp. Though he recovered from his illnesses, Alberto Cernogoraz was murdered in 1946.
