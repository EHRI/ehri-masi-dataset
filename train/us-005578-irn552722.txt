Dr. Meldola was deported to Auschwitz in August 1944 and tattooed with prisoner number A-25140. In December 1944 she was transferred to Bergen Belsen concentration camp, and in March 1945 she was taken to the subcamp of Buchenwald. Dr. Meldola wrote this letter to her three sisters in the US: Erika, Grete and Were Luise (donor's mother) in which she described her experiences.
