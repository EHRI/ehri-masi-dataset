Eva Metzger Brown (1938- ) was born in Furth Germany to her parents Ernst and Doris Metzger. The family fled the country soon after Kristallnacht to Paris, France. Ernst was placed in a detention camp, while Doris and Eva moved to the French town of Angers. In June of 1940, a German air raid bombed Angers, leaving Doris and Eva both injured; Doris had a leg amputated while Eva suffered from shrapnel lodged in her head. With the eventual German occupation of France, the detention camp system crumbled and Ernst was free. The Metzger’s were able to meet up once again, and traveled to Toulouse where they discovered that the family had made the quota for immigration into the United States, after being sponsored by a cousin of Doris’. They arrived in the United States in August, 1941.

The Eva Metzger Brown collection contains three primary records. The first two are affidavits for her parents, Ernst and Doris Metzger. These affidavits were required for the Metzger family to immigrate into the United States. Also included in the collection are two copies of Eva’s memoir, titled “Healing from the Traumas of the Holocaust and the Years Thereafter.” They recount the early years of Eva’s life, as well as her parent’s background. The memoir also details Eva’s experiences growing up in the United States as a young child.
