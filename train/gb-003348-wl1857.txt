Ludwig Steiner: Dachau concentration camp release permit

1 folder

Ludwig Steiner was born in 1872 in Zirl, Austria. He was arrested on 29 September 1939 and imprisoned at the Gestapo prison Innsbruck. Every day one person of the family "kept watch" and stood outside the prison as Ludwig Steiner could sometimes be seen at a window on the top floor of the building. On 7 December 1939 he was transferred to Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg concentration camp and later to Dachau. He was released on 20 September 1940 having lost almost 50 kg of body weight and having sustained severe internal and external injuries.

This collection contains a photocopy of Ludwig Steiner's release permit ('Entlassungsschein') from Dachau concentration camp. Due to his Jewish background Steiner was arrested and spent one year at Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg and later Dachau concentration camp before being released mortally ill in September 1940.
