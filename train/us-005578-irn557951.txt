The Polish Consulate in Opole (Polnisches Konsulat in Oppeln) operated during the interwar period in Oppeln. The Consular office in the rank of the consul general was opened on April 1, 1920 as the representative of the Polish government to the Inter-Commission for the Ruling and Plebiscite in Upper Silesia. Since 1920, the consulate was located in the "Bank of Farmers" building, at Nikolaistraße 36a (Mikołowska Street). After the liquidation of the Commission in 1922 the office was transferred to Bytom. In 1931, the consul returned to Opole to represent Polish affairs in the German Opolskie Regierungsbezirk (Oppeln). The general consulate was located on the island Pasieke (Pascheke) at Eichstraße 1 (today the Consular Street), which was previously the orphanage of the Prussian House (Preussenhaus). In 1938, the rank of this office was reduced from a general consulate to a consulate. The Polish Consulate in Opole functioned until 1939.
