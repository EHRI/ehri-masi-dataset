Jews at forced labor

Jews at forced labor digging a trench. Some of the men are in the trench, which has been reinforced with boards, and some beside it. They are very aware of the camera. Close-up of one man as he digs. The men unload bricks from the back of a truck. At least three types of Star of David badges can be seen. Most of the men have badges on the backs of their coats; one man has two. At least two of the men also have stars stencilled on the sides of their coats. A female overseer is visible in the background, yelling at the men (01:35:47). Close-ups of several of the laborers as they unload the bricks then push dollies loaded with bricks along a set of tracks.
