Albert C. Kornblum (14 Apr 1909-24 Apr 1992) was born in New York and worked as a lawyer. He enlisted in the US military in March 1942, was with the American troops who liberated Dachau in April 1945, and interrogated Julius Streicher and Robert Ley in the months before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.

The Albert C. Kornblum papers consists of a certificate signed by Adolf Hitler, a certificate signed by Heinrich Himmler, a photograph of Nuremberg Stadium, a letter to Kornblum from US Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, and a map documenting the advance of the 15th Corps of the First, Third, and Seventh Armies from July 1944 to May 1945. The certificate signed by Hitler awards the first stage of the Honor Cross for German Mothers to Franziska Seefeldner. The certificate signed by Himmler awards the Death’s Head Ring of the SS to SS Obersturmführer Oskar Röntgen. The stadium photograph was originally taken by Kurt Grimm in 1936, is annotated “After V-E Day. No Nazi flags remaining then. July 4, 1945 Nuremberg Stadium Germany,” and is autographed by Larry Adler, Jack Benny, and Ingrid Bergman. Justice Frankfurter’s letter to Kornblum comments on the latter’s interrogation of Julius Streicher and Robert Ley in the months before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.
