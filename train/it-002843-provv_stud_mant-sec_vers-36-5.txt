These documents are very important, as they attest the way in which discriminatory laws were applied in the Italian school system, too. Starting from November 1938 no one who was considered to be “of Jewish race” was allowed to work in any public place; thus, special schools - only for “Jewish” students - were created (Jewish children who had been baptized might ask to be enrolled in private Catholic schools). Teachers could be Jewish or not. This file contains official documents concerning anti-Semitic laws and practical advices for its fulfilment; requests made by Jewish people to be hired as teachers in the Mantua Elementary Jewish school (run by Renato Rovighi, a Jew who had received a medal for his military value and had been former director of the same public school), such as Lidia Viterbi, Fiorina Pisa, Maria Pia Foà, Silvana Rossi, Paola Lombroso; statistical data about Jewish schools in Mantua and its province (number of students, location, etc.).
