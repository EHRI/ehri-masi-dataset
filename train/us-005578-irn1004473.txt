Goebbels visits troops in the last days

Goebbels visits the front town of Lauban (Luban, Poland) on March 6th, 1945. He meets with General Ferdinand Schoerner. Goebbels greets troops, including 16 year old Hitler Youth member Wilhelm Huebner, on the market square of the town. View of the square shot through a broken window pane. Goebbels speaks to the soldiers. Graphic shots of dead civilians from the same area. The narrator describes the perpetrators as Untermenschen and the associates of Roosevelt's Christian soldiers. Original sound of Goebbels giving a speech in Goerlitz. He says that the German soldiers will show no mercy to the enemy on the Eastern Front and that Hitler will overcome this crisis as he has in the past. He tells of a conversation in which Hitler stated that he believes that victory will be theirs. CUs of men and women in the crowd. After Goebbels is finished speaking the crowd is led in a chorus of "Sieg Heil."
