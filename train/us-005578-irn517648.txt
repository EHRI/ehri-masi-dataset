Yiddish newspaper, Ibergang, for August 5, 1948, obtained by Kasriel Ejlender in Fohrenwald displaced persons camp in Germany, where he lived from circa 1945-1948. After Germany invaded Soviet territory in June 1941, eighteen year old Kasriel and his family had to move into the Jewish ghetto in Dereczyn, Poland. In May 1942, Kasriel was deported to a German labor camp in Mogilev. For the next three years, he was transferred to a series of concentration camps: Majdanek, Płaszów, Gross-Rosen, and Langenbielau. He was liberated in spring 1945 by Soviet forces. He worked as a translator for the Soviet Army and when the war ended in May 1945, he moved to Fohrenwald. Kasriel began medical school in Munich in 1946. In 1948, he emigrated to the United States with the help of relatives. He eventually learned that that his mother, father, and sister had joined Russian partisans in the woods, where they died of exposure and hunger; his brother had been shot and killed during deportation.
