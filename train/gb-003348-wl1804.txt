1 box

Marianne Elsley (n√©e Josephy, c1923-2009) grew up in a small town near Berlin in the 1920s. After Hitler came to power life became increasingly difficult for the family. With the passing of Anti-Jewish legislation aimed at eliminating Jews from public life, Marianne was no longer able to attend her school. As there was no Jewish school in her home town the family had to move to Berlin. Marianne's father, a judge, was dismissed from his job and her mother, a doctor, was no longer allowed to practice. Marianne's parents decided to arrange for their daughter to leave the country on a Kindertransport. She left when she was 15 years old, arriving in England in March 1939. She was taken care of by a family in Hampstead. During the war years she trained to become a nurse. She later got married to Ralph Elsley, a teacher. </span><br><div><div><span style="line-height: 1.22;"><br></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.22;">Marianne's parents were deported to Terezin concentration camp in 1943.
