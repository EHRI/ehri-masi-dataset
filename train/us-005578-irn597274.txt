He had one older brother, Joseph (c.1914-c.1997), and one older sister. His father owned two restaurants and was also a cantor. Henry was deported to the Łódź ghetto. He fled Poland for Russia and was in Tashkent (Uzbekistan) at the end of the war. His parents and sister all perished during the Holocaust. His brother Joseph survived in the Dachau concentration camp. Henry lived in Munich after the war. He immigrated to the United States in 1951 and settled in New York.

They had three children: Jerrold (b. 1954), Sherry (b. 1959), and Bruce (b. 1961).
