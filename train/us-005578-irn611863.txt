"Die Warheit" was founded in 1899 as a biweekly newspaper with a liberal political outlook. After the First World War, "Die Warheit" was acquired by the Union of Australian Jews and become a weekly. The newspaper presented the position that the roots of Judaism lay in religion, and it opposed both Jewish nationalism and socialism. "Die Warheit" declared the task to fight against antisemitism and defend the legal rights of Austrian Jews. The newspaper was closed following the Anschluss in 1938.

The collection contains correspondence with members of the Union of Austrian Jews and various subscribers, with religious communities, Jewish organizations, the Hungarian parliament, and the publishers.

The collection includes issues of the newspaper “Die Wahreit” for 1937. Note: USHMM Archives holds only selected records.
