Bulgarians commemorate uprising

A Bulgarian town commemorates the uprising of April 20, 1876, in which Bulgarian nationalist rebels mounted an insurrection against the ruling Ottoman Empire. Men in uniform march a flag into the town square, while rows of uniformed soldiers, a group of men wearing military decorations, and hundreds of civilians look on. Several flag bearers march from different directions toward the center of the square, and the painting of a rebel and the words '20 Apr. 1876,' which adorns the side of a building in the square, is decorated with greenery for the occasion. A group of men (veterans of the uprising?) in what appear to be Nazi dress walk across the square and shake hands with a civilian, and give the Nazi salute. A band leads the group in a parade which includes soldiers, civilians, and girls in traditional dress, to a stone memorial in a wooded clearing where a man places a wreath while an Orthodox priest looks on. Back in the town square, crowds congregate and some people dance.
