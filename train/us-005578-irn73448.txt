Contains hundreds of memoirs, diaries, and other written accounts created by former prisoners of Majdanek and nearby camps. Most of these accounts were collected as the result of five projects organized by the State Museum of Majdanek from 1965 to 1980. The projects sought to document how the camps and prisons in the Lublin region operated, the help rendered to victims, children, and the history of the camp of KL Majdanek. Some diaries have been published, and some are just copies obtained from other archives.
