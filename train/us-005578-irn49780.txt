Gerszon Dua-Bogen (1892-1948) was a member of Poalej Syjon left party, and since 1922 he was active in the international communist movement in Poland, Palestine, USSR, USA, France, Spain and Cuba. He returned to Poland in 1947 and worked for the Polish communist party, Komitet Centralny Polskiej Partii Robotniczej (KC PPR), and then was delegated to work for the Centralny Comitet Żydow Polskich (CKŻP). He was a distinguished personage; it seemed that he would play a significant role as one of the leaders of the Faction of the Polish Labor Party (the ethnic Jewish section of that party). He perished in a car accident near Bielsk at the beginning of February 1948.
