Elliot Schwartz: Tapestry

In the piano trio Tapestry, Schwartz addresses the Holocaust by paying tribute to the Danes who saved so many Jews from the Nazis in World War II. In true post-modernist style, snippets of music from concentration camp composers appear alongside images of war and menace, together with fragments of a Danish children'â€™s folk song, showing the innocence and purity the world could project in contrast to the horrors it so often shows us. Recorded for New World CD Rene Jolles, violin Brent Samuel, cello Blair McMillian, piano
