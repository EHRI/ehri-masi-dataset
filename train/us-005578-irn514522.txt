United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

David H. Pollock, a Jewish officer with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, was at Buchenwald concentration camp soon after liberation. He collected the names and addresses of relatives of liberated prisoners and wrote to them that their family members were still alive and needed their assistance. Due to his efforts, many Holocaust survivors were united with their families.

The papers consist of an envelope and three letters to David H. Pollock concerning the search for Israel Ajzenberg (later known as Harold Eisenberg) and Mrs. Chaim Rosenbaum [sister of Israel Ajzenberg] by their families. One letter was written by Claude Renaud, Chief Constable of Windsor, Ontario, and another letter was written by C.W. Farrow, also Chief Constable of Windsor, Ontario.
