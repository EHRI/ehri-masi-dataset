The Transportlisten series consists of two parts : KD_00013_01 : The first part contains the carbon doubles of the original lists of all transports (Jews, Roma and Sinti) from the SS-Sammellager Mecheln (Dossin barracks) to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Buchenwald, Ravensbrück, Vittel and Bergen-Belsen. Each sheet contains the names of 10 to 20 deportees on a specific transport, their place and date of birth, their profession and their nationality. In some cases the date of arrival at the Dossin barracks is mentioned in the top left corner of the page. The handwritten notes were added by the Directorate-General War Victims after the war while doing research on deportees and survivors. KD_00013_02 : The second part contains additional administrative documents among which we can distinct three types. 1° The Aufnahme (camp administration) created statistics based on the deportation lists and also kept lists of persons liberated from the SS-Sammellager Mecheln, such as Jews with the Belgian nationality in the summer of 1943. 2° The Aide aux Israélites Victimes de la Guerre, the organisation which took over the care for the remaining prisoners upon liberation, drafted lists of the persons still in the camp on 4 September 1944 : prisoners registered for transport XXVII, employee-prisoners (Werkleute), Entscheidung cases (decision regarding deportation still to be made), special cases… 3° The Directorate-general War Victims drafted postwar lists containing the names of all persons repatriated (organised by transport). Part KD_00013_02 is only accessible at the Kazerne Dossin reading room and reading rooms of partner institutes.
