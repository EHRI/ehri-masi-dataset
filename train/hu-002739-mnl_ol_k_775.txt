The Arrow Cross Ministry of the Interior was headed by Gábor Vajna (1891-1946) who was a soldier, politician and member of Parliament after 1939. Vajna belonged among the Hungarians who were in close contact with the German occupiers after March 19, 1944, including those who were implementing the Holocaust. As Minister of the Interior in the government of Szálasi, Vajna was responsible for the attempted reorganization of the Hungarian state along dictatorial-totalitarian lines. He agreed to German requests to provide altogether around 75 000 Hungarian Jewish slave laborers for the German war industry, a high percentage of whom perished in death marches, in the Nazi camp system or at their place of slave labor. The collection contains miscellaneous documents of the Arrow Cross Ministry of the Interior. They address a variety of subjects such as personnel issues, the police, the Jews, legal aliens, refugees, passports, evaculations, repatriations, air raids, the problem of procurements, fire control and several others.
