I'm An American -- Edith Kempthorne

On September 28, 1941 Edith Kempthorne spoke with Joseph Savoretti, Deputy Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, about why she's proud to call America home. Edith talks about her large family and growing up in New Zealand. She credits her family for fostering her love of the great outdoors. She shares the history of the CampFire Girls and how she became involved with the organization. Ms. Kempthorne confesses she was scared to become a citizen. The National Field Secretary reveals she brought two campfire girls to the studio with her, 10-year-old refugee Ruth Sandman and 16-year-old Czech-Viennese refugee Maddie Pospisil. The girls talk about their experience in America, why they love the CampFire Girls and how the organization has taught them American citizenship. The program ends with Kempthorne stating the spirit of cooperation leads to a happy, healthy and productive life. Edith Kempthorne was born the oldest of 16 children in New Zealand. To save money, her large family often spent time outdoors and took camping trips. In 1912, Edith traveled to Alaska to visit a friend. There she heard about the CampFire Girls and attended Camp Sebago-Wohelo in Maine, where the organization started. In accordance with the CampFire Girl slogan “Give Service”, Edith became a camp counselor, started new groups and encouraged other children to join. She went on to become the National Field Secretary of the Camp Fire Girls. Edith represented the organization for 36 years before returning to her homeland of New Zealand.
