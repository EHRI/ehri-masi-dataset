When it was established in 1919, the Department of Economic Policy of the Foreign Ministry dealt with issues of economic policy, meaning primarily the peace negotiations, issues related to the peace treaty as well as international economic contracts, as well as issues of international transport and of financial and social policy. In the years of the inter-war period, the exact administrative relations between the administering of these issues underwent numerous changes. The collection contains a large corpus of documents that belong to three basic categories. The first one contains the documents from the years 1918 to 1930 when the Department of Economic Policy kept on being reorganized. The second contains those from the years 1931 to 1942. Third, documents of lesser administrative relevance created from the second half of the 1920s onward are contained in dossiers divided by country and subject.
