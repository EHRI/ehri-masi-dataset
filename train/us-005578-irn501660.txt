Contains a copy of a booklet entitled "19 Wasted Months: diary and notes of my internment" by Kurt Lewinski. The booklet, which is a typed English translation of the original German, describes Lewinski's experiences in an internment camp for enemy aliens in England; life on the HMT Dunera ship, which transported him to Australia in 1940; and life in the Hay, New South Wales and in the Tatura internment camps. The text is written in the form of daily diary entries, and includes two epilogues written in 1942 and 1945 which reveal that Mr. Lewinski joined the Australian military.
