Consists of one typescript biography, 44 pages, entitled: "Simon: from Darkness at the Break of Noon 'til Dawn's Early Light, an Abridged Oral History" by Dave Hunterman (pen name), written in 2011. Huntermann describes the experiences of his father, Simon Silver, who was born in Chelm, Poland. After the German invasion and after briefly spending time in the Warsaw ghetto, he returned to Chelm and managed to briefly escape deportation. He was sent on a death march and bribed a Nazi soldier with a gold coin to avoid being shot. Simon, his brother, brother-in-law, and friend escaped during a death march in the middle of the night. They spent the rest of the war in a Siberian labor camp. In Russia after the war, Simon married a woman from Zamosc, Poland, who spent the war in hiding in the forest; they emigrated to the United States in 1949. Also includes three post-war photographs of Simon Silver in Chelm, including an image of Simon with his brother Hirsch holding a memorial tombstone and a photograph of a group memorializing the Jews of Chelm who perished in the Holocaust. Also includes a copy of a military government document attesting to Simcha Silberblech (Simon Silver) life at the Heidenheim displaced persons camp.
