Contains various documents of the Polish Underground Army (Home Army), a military organization of the resistance movements during World War II. Established in February 1942 as a successor to the November 13, 1939-established Zwiazek Walki Zbrojnej (Union for Armed Combat), it became a part of Polish Armed Forces under the control of the Polish Government-in-Exile. The Home Army’s long-term aim was to prepare for a general uprising at the moment of Germany’s defeat; its operations culminated in the 63-day Warsaw Uprising in the summer of 1944.
