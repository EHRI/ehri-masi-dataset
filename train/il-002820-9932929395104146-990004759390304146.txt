1 electronic resource (13 pages)

The file contains a detailed, confidentiqal report by the German Embassy in Paris addressed to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin dated 04.08.1933 intended as a situational report pertaining to decree P2143 from 26.04.1933 regarding Anti-German propaganda in France. In this assessment three main sources of Anti-German Propaganda in France are thoroughly discussed: Firstly, the fear of a political and economic remergence of Germany that could threaten France's strong position in Europe, and which is a sentiment that is commonly shared among all French political parties and across the political spectrum. Secondly, cultural animosity in France regarding the Nationa-Socialist ideology, which stems from the fact that average French citizens neither understand nor condone the goals of the "national" movement in Germany. Thirdly, the report names economic reasons for Anti-German Propaganda due to German exports within Europe and means of promoting it. Furthermore, it describes the French press and Polish, Anti-German Propaganda, in France in more detail. Lastly, the report also covers measures of Counter-Propaganda and supports the idea to allow and promote travel of German students in France as well of French students in Germany in order to make the goals of the new National-Socialist government in Germany more broadly known in France and thereby decrease animosity.
