Max Vielgut, the younger brother of the donorâ€™s mother, was born in 1909 in Vienna, Austria, where he studied music and worked as a musician. After the annexation of Austria by Germany, he fled to Belgium, where he remained from 1939 until the German invasion. He was captured and imprisoned by the Germans in 1940, and was later transferred to Saint-Cyprien camp in France. In November, he and the other prisoners were transferred to Gurs. In early 1941, he was assigned to a Foreign Worker Unit in Agen. In September, he was moved to Lyon, where he was a working musician. He was later sent to Blechhammer, then Buchenwald, where he perished in 1945, when the camp was liberated.
