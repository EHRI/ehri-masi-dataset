1

Contains a letter written by Louise and Betty Brandeis, distant relatives of Justice Louis D. Brandeis, dated April 16, 1938 in Vienna. In the letter the two sisters ask Justice Brandeis to help them to come to the United States since life under the new anti-Jewish laws made it impossible for them to work. Justice Brandeis noted on the first page that he received the letter on May 13 (1938). According to a ship manifest, the two sisters sailed on board the SS Europa from Cherbourg, France arriving in New York on July 20, 1938.
