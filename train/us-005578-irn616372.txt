Contains a handwritten memoir, in Yiddish, illustrating Michael Kutz's experiences during the Holocaust in Poland. Born in 1930 in Nieśwież, Poland, Michael survived a mass execution and escaped. After seeking some refuge in the home of his father's friend, he joined the Jewish Partisans participating in anti-Nazi activities and survived WWII. The memoir became the basis for the book "If, By Miracle" (Toronto: The Azrieli Foundation, 2013).
