Hans Julius Cahnmann (1906-1999) was born on 27 January 1916 in Munich, Germany to Sigwart (1872-1942) and Hedwig Cahnmann (n√©e Schulein, 1882-1942). He graduated from Gymnasium in 1924, and received his Ph.D in Pharmacology in 1930. Hans moved to Paris in 1933 and worked in the pharmaceutical industry. In 1939 he applied for a U.S. visa. Hans and other foreign-born Jews were rounded up and sent to the stadium in May 1940, and then transported to a camp near Tours. He then went to Marseilles while waiting for his visa. After receiving help from American journalist Varian Fry and the Emergency Rescue Committee, Hans immigrated to the United States, arriving on 5 August 1941 aboard the SS Guine via Casablanca, Morocco. Hans married Ruth Hedwig Heilbroner (1920-2008) in 1945. Both of his parents perished during the Holocaust.
