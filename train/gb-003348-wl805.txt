Ernst Cohn-Wiener, Maurice Laserson: correspondence and papers

1 folder

The collection was clearly originally the property of Dr. Maurice Laserson.

For biographical information on Dr. Maurice Laserson see Wiener Library Biographical news-cuttings section (G15).

This collection of correspondence documents the friendship between the art historian, Professor Ernst Cohn-Wiener and Dr. Maurice Laserson. It covers such subjects as Cohn-Wiener's travel experiences and the art treasures and traditions of various countries. It also documents his experience in India including comments on the situation of the indigenous Jewish population there (805/2/14). Much of the correspondence consists of mundane matters such as discussions about travel arrangements and comments on health- particularly during Cohn-Wiener's stay in India. Dr. Maurice Laserson also makes mention of his activities in relation to his involvement with ORT (Organisation for Rehabilitation through Training). The latter part of the correspondence deals with efforts by Maurice Laserson, in Australia, to find suitable employment and an entry permit for Ernst Cohn-Wiener for that country.
