The Position of the Jews in Germany (March)

1 electronic resource (25 pages)

The file contains a report from March 1936 about the position of the Jews in Germany written in English and German. The Jewish Central information Office published every month a new report, regarding the situation of Jews in Germany. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). The report is divided into 11 chapters, starting with 'Concerns for the Olympiad' 'the Brake of the Reich Ministry of Economics and the Drive of the Labour Front', 'The Indirect Intimidation of Christian Shoppers and its Concecquences', 'The Case of the Brothers Weinberg', 'The Jewish Commercial Representatives steadily gettig ruined', 'Now the Turn of the Physicians', 'The Merciless Chamber of Culture', 'The Economic Champain of Annihilation Has a Catastrophic Effect on the Jewish Communities', 'The Surrendering of Passports and its Consequences', 'The danger of Jewish Gathering' and 'The Summary'. The position of German Jewry seemed to have entered a stage of outward quitness. The Olympiad, which was at 1936 dominating the whole public life in Germany, has forced a cunning change of methods and an outward quit. Efforts were made to show the visitors how peacefully and quitly the Jews live in Germany. But this should not delude anyone into the belief that the fight against the Jews had ceased, so the author argued. Further infromations, published by the Reichs Press Chamber, regarding a list and further instructions about the exclusion of News and Reporting Agencies.
