Left Book Club: leaflets

1 folder

The Left Book Club was a very successful radical left wing group that flourished in Great Britain from the mid 1930s to the beginning of WWII. It was started in 1936 by the barrister, Stafford Cripps, and publisher Victor Gollancz, with the goal of selling left wing books at very cheap prices. Those who joined agreed to buy at least one book a month for a 6 month period. By 1939 it had 57,000 members and sold about 6 million books. During the war the British Communist Party agitated for an end to war and transformed a number of Left Book Club groups into "Stop the War" committees. By the end of WWII there were only 7,000 subscribers and it formally shut down in 1948.
