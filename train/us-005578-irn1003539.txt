German Condor Legion in Spain

Onscreen titles: "Deutsche Freiwillige in Spanien" [German volunteers in Spain]. And: "Der erste Filmbericht vom Kampf der Legion Condor" [First film report about fighting of the Condor Legion]. Views of a city (or cities) in Spain. Beautiful landmarks and churches, interrupted by a shot of a bomb-damaged building. The narrator states that in 1936 began a wave of senseless terror, whose barbaric hate knew no bounds. Spanish Republicans are shown taking target practice at a statue, riding in the back of a truck through the streets, and otherwise exhibiting their barbaric natures. Spanish civilians who had fled the violence are shown living in a cave in the mountains. A portrait of General Francisco Franco, leader of the Nationalists in Spain, appears on the screen as the narrator explains that the General called on Germany for help. German planes in the sky, flying over Spain. The planes land and the film cuts off at this point. During the Spanish Civil War, Hitler aided Franco by sending him the airplanes and personnel that formed the Condor Legion. This served the purposes of aiding a fascist leader in his fight against leftist forces and testing out the German Air Force in a combat situation.
