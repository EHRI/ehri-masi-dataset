Documents and photographs illustrating the experiences of Heinrich [Henryk] Werdinger (donor). Born in Borysław, Poland, he was arrested and interned as a slave laborer in Borysław, in 1942 for Karpathen Oel AG. In April 1944, he was first transferred to the Płaszow concentration camp, and then to the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria in August 1944, where he was liberated in May 1945. His immediate family perished. Included in the collection are photographs that document pre-war life in Borysław, postwar documents and photographs which illustrate Heinrich’s wartime experiences and post-war life in Vienna, Austria where he attended school before ultimately immigrating to the United States via the Marine Marlin in December 1948.
