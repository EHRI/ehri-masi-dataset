Two postcards sent to Cesia Greenberg in Brooklyn, NY from Regina Weinman in Warsaw, Poland, March 31, 1940, October 12, 1941. The first postcard regards obtaining an affidavit of support for Zdzislaw Weinman. The second postcard inquires about not receiving a letter from Cesia in a while, and asks after friends or family members. Both postcards are stamped with Wehrmacht censor stamps, and the postcard written in 1941 also has a Warsaw Judenrat censor stamp.
