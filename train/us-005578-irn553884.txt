Magyar Híradó 652. Intertitle: “ITTHON. A fóväros közönsége határtalan lelkesedés-sel fogadta a dicsósé-gesen szerepelt magyar olimpiai verseny-zóket. M.F.I.” People walk in a parade. Some women hold a flag bearing the symbol of the Olympics. Others hold bouquets of flowers. Men walk in a line holding on to one another. Police in pointed helmets stand at the front of the crowd. Young boys in the crowd wave. The attention is focused on a small circle of men speaking in the middle. People celebrate the olympians. Some are lifted onto the shoulders of their family and friends. One holds a flag, the other a bouquet. The crowd waves as cars drive away. People wave from a building that says “HERMES FILM.” Two men and four girls wave from the roof of a car at the crowd and camera. Then comes five men waving from the roof of a car. A huge crowd of people sits at the base of Millennium Monument in Budapest. Young men and women (the Hungarian Olympians?), dressed in white, march through the streets carrying flags and victory wreaths. Crowds of people run. A band plays. People lay their wreaths down by an Olympic flag on the ground. The team included at least one Jewish athlete.
