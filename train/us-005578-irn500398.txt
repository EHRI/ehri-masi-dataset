1

Max Bayer (b. 1906) and his wife, Gisela Bayer (n√©e Schrage, b. 1906) lived in Berlin, Germany where Max taught at a school for the deaf. Their daughter named Reha was born in 1942. During World War II, Max was employed as a guard at a concentration camp. During one of his shifts, two prisoners escaped. He and his family were arrested and deported to Auschwitz on 17 May 1943 where they likely perished.

The collection consists of a photocopy of a letter from Katharina Jakobsohn to a Mrs. Stern regarding the fate of Max and Gisela Bayer and their daughter Reha Bayer in Berlin, Germany, all of whom were deported to Auschwitz in 1943 where they likely perished. Also included are two poems and a partial English translation.
