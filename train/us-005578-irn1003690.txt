Radio truck seeks listeners; Roma

Two trucks with the phrase "werdet Rundfunkhoerer" [become radio listeners] emblazoned on their sides enter a small town. Children follow after the trucks eagerly. There is a loudspeaker visible on top of one of the trucks. The children crowd around the trucks as a man distributes leaflets. The truck is shown parked at the base of a rotating windmill. The next part of the clip shows a group of Roma/Sinti gathered around a cooking fire and standing in front of the radio wagon. They laugh and wave at the camera. A group of children plays a ring-around-the-rosy game.
