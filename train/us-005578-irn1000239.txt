Soviet POWs; Nazis in Vilna

Minsk: Surrendered Soviet soldiers/POWs, all walk along road. With turbans, Asian facial features. MLS, sign, "Berlin-Breslau-Moskau." Vilna: Infantry arrives, walks down country road, proud, tired. A few townspeople and children greet German soldiers with flowers. Watch from in town and along road. Tanks line edge of road.
