Helena Bronka Zybert (b. Chaja Bajla Hercberg) was born on November 18, 1919, in Warsaw, Poland, to Abram and Ita Hercberg. In September 1939, Bronka's boyfriend, Zygmunt Zybert, a Polish-Catholic and soldier in the Polish Army, was imprisoned in a POW camp. When he was released in December 1940, he found false papers for Bronka and was able to help her escape from the Warsaw ghetto. On July 10, 1942, Bronka married Zygmunt Zybert under her false name "Helena Werlichowicz." The couple continued finding and hiding Jews and obtaining baptismal certificates for others until the end of World War II.

The papers consist of documents, photographs, letters, and identification cards relating to the experiences of Bronka Hercberg Zybert and her family in the ghetto in Warsaw, Poland, during World War II.
