The collection consists of four photographs depicting the bodies of concentration camp prisoners killed by the SS near Gardelegen, Germany. The corpses had been pulled out of a nearby barn by German civilians under the supervision of the U.S. Army. Captions are written on the verso by John Jeppi [donor's father] who served with the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II.
