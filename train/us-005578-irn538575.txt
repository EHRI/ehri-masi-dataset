Dachau photograph collection

folder

1

Contains post-liberation photographs identified as the Dachau concentration camp. The photos belonged to a medic who was donor's great uncle (name unknown). Some images are labeled on verso; one is addressed to "Eddie" [Edward Galarneau, donor's paternal grandfather]. The images were likely taken clandestinely and show various scenes of victims in rail cars and on horse-drawn carriages.
