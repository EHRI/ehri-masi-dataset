The Goldstein family letters consists of letters sent by Hinda Goldstein and her children in Lviv, Poland, to her daughters, Marimtzia (Molly), Rivka (Regina) and Chantzia (Ann), who had immigrated to the United States. The letters, written between 1927-1941, detail the hardships and poverty of life in Lviv, as well as the desire to come to the United States and the fear of the impending war.
