Werner Sallisohn (later Bill Sallerson, 1910-2004) was born on 30 October 1910 in Berlin, Germany to Israel and Bertha (née Mehrowitz) Sallisohn. He had at least one half-sister, Hildegard. He married Rosa Lucie Wjnker in 1935 in Bielefeld, Germany. Facing increased persecution in Berlin, they fled Germany around 1939 for Shanghai, China. They remained there for the duration of the war, and immigrated to the United States in 1947. They settled in Minnesota. His half-sister and other family members perished during the Holocaust.

Rosa Sallisohn (née Wynker) was born on 20 August 1914 in Berlin, Germany to Samuel and Berta (née Fuchs) Wjnker.

The collection documents the wartime experiences of Werner and Rosa Sallisohn, originally of Berlin, Germany, who lived as refugees in Shanghai, China from 1939-1947 before immigrating to the United States. Included are birth certificates, Chinese identification papers, immigration documents, business documents regarding a potential job opportunity in Argentina for Werner, and correspondence. Some of the correspondence is from Werner's half-sister Hildegard, who perished during the Holocaust.
