Fausto Sabatello (July 18, 1905) was married to Renate Piperno (b. March 19, 1913) and they had a son Franco Eitan (b. April 10, 1941). They lived in Rome, Italy where Fausto was an agent for coffee and spices. In October 1943, when Germans entered Rome, the family went to live with Christian friends for about a month. Fausto began to forge identity cards and used several different names including Pietro Ausuinelli for Fausto. During the time that they were in hiding, a plumber was needed at the home. The plumber knew Fausto and knew that he was Jewish, so the family had to flee immediately. Renate left with Franco to a convent in Monte Mario. Fausto moved from one apartment to another and he continued to work and earn money using false identity cards. Fausto, Renate, and Franco survived the war and Fausto and Renate had a second child, Anat Sabatello (b. May 18, 1945).

The collection consists of false identity cards belonging to Renate Piperno and Fausto Sabatello; letters and notes written by Michele Sabatello in the Fossoli concentration camp; a document excluding a representative of a cheese factory from work; a document from the Archbishop of Florence; a document from Massalombarda SA; an identity pass permit for work along with a photograph for Pietro Ansuinelli (a false identity of Fausto Sabatello); a ration card for bread and soup; and an announcement by Fausto Sabatello, searching for his brother Michele Sabatello.
