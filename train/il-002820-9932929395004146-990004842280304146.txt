1 electronic resource (2 pages)

This file contains a layout for a letter, presumably written by Georges Brunschvig (no name or signature found). He addresses himself (also presumably as he doesn't say names but calls him "Mister President") to the president of the Swiss court. In this letter he describes to him the first conference of the Bern trials with Fleischauer describing his inadequate behaviour in his favour.
