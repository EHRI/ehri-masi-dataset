Bernard Nissenbaum (born Berysz Bernard Nissenbaum) was born on 18 July 1895 in Łódź, Poland. He worked as a diamond cutter before the war. He was arrested and deported from a village in southern France in 1942, and survived several concentration and labor camps including Pawiak, Drancy, Lyon-Venissieux, Majdanek, Trzebinia, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, and Dachau. He was liberated from the Dachau concentration camp by the U.S. Army. Bernard immigrated to the United States in 1947 aboard the SS Marine Tiger.

Testimony. Photocopy of typescript, 80 pages, titled "Meine Deportation," unattributed on text, but is apparently from Bernard Nissenbaum. In it, he describes his experiences beginning with his 1942 arrest and deportation from a village in southern France, through various camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau. Also contains two photos of Nissenbaum, one at end of war in 1945, and one of him at the age of 90, in 1982.
