The Czechoslovak schools in Great Britain were created and funded by the Czechoslovak Goverment-In-Exile. Education for refugee children was initiated in October 1940. Approx. 1500 children studied at these schools, including more than 670 mostly Jewish children saved by Nicolas Winton. The system of the Czechoslovak schools was gradually built up during 1940-1945.
 
The archival material had been collected since 1985 by Judith Wolt (the wife of John Wolt, one of the former students). She tried to gather everything that was connected with the Czechoslovak´s schools in the United Kingdom, she contacted many former students, and received documents from them.

The collection consist of originals and copies of the various documents, such as copies of identity documents, birth certificates, writing pads, textbooks, school certificates, photographs, messages from teachers to parents (or to the legal representatives of children), memoirs, school notes, presentations and newspapers. These materials also relate to more than 670 mostly Jewish children saved by the Kindertransporte organised by Nicolas Winton and other rescuers.
