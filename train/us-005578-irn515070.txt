Mr. Cohen served as an infantryman in Cannon Company of th 180 Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division. After the liberation of Dachau, his company was brought in to relieve the troops there, and after a day or two, they rejoined their division on the attack on Munich. They were then sent back to Dachau to guard the SS and prevent inmates from escaping. Some of the SS prisoners were the german soldiers that committed the atrocities against the Americans in Malmedy. Mr. Cohen may have been the first Jewish soldier to guard the SS. He was honorably discharged from the Army on December 25, 1945.

The photograph depicts Allen Cohen [donor] guarding SS prisoners at Dachau concentration camp after liberation.
