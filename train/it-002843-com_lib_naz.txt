Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale di Mantova e Provincia

60 folders and 10 registers

This fonds contains acts of the Committee created after the liberation of Italy from Nazi-fascism, on July 25th, 1945. The Mantua Committee had previously worked secretly, since July, 1944. The National Liberation Committee watched over public order, waiting for democratic election. Local committees depended on District Committee, which in turn was subordinated to the Regional one. In the fonds there are also pictures testifying atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis against Italian soldiers, in September 1943.
