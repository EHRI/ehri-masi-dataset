Correspondence from the Ziskind family in Krewo, Poland (today in Belarus) to Sadie Nechama Ziskind, later Alpert, in Chicago, IL. The letters are written in Yiddish, between 1929-1939. In most of the letters the Ziskind family asks for additional correspondence and some financial support. Sadie Ziskind left Krewo in 1915 just being 16 years old. She married William Alpert and they had three children: Edith, Jean, and Louis.
