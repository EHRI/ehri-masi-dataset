Zofia Burowska collection

folder

1

Contains documents and photographs regarding the Holocaust experiences of Zofia (Chorowicz) Burowska and her parents. Includes a postcard Zofia received from her father, dated July 1938, and the last letter she received from her mother before she was killed. Zofia and her mother were, at first, together in a Wolbrom Ghetto outside of Krakow and Zofia managed to get out and move to a Labor Camp in Krakow (Julag.) She tried desperately to get her mother there too. She finally managed to get someone to retrieve her mother, but at that point her mother was already killed and this letter was the only thing left.
