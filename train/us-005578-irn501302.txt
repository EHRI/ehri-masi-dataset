Consists of an essay written by Henry Bauer, who was born in Mannheim, Germany, in 1917. Mr. Bauer emigrated to the United States in February 1940, joined the American military and was sent to North Africa and assigned to administer Allied internment camps for German and Italian prisoners of war. He was transferred to Italy and then participated in the invasion of southern France. After the end of the war, he found out that his parents, who were not able to emigrate prior to the war, were deported and killed in Auschwitz. This essay, 2 pages, was excerpted from an article published in the December 1991 issue of B'nai B'rith magazine.
