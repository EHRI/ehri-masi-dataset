During the second half of the 19th century, the small port of Kavala began to evolve into a processing hub of the legendary Eastern tobacco industry and became an exporting centre that served the Ottoman and the European markets. In 1880, a large number of Jewish tobacco traders and workers from Thessaloniki and other areas of the Empire joined the small core of Jewish families that had already been living inside the Castle of Kavala. The Tsimino family left Serres and settled in Kavala at the end of the 19th century.
