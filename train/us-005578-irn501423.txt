Hans R. Fliegel (1920- ) was born in Vienna to Dr. Julius Fliegel, a diamond merchant, and Ilona Fliegel (nee Blau). His family left Vienna for Antwerp in July 1938 and immigrated to the United States in November 1939. His father re-established himself in the diamond business while Fliegel worked as a diamond polisher, bookkeeper, and then draftsman.

The Hans R. Fliegel memoir, "The Holocaust and the Viennese Family Fliegel", describes Fliegel’s childhood in Vienna, the Anschluss, Isidore Lipschutz’s help securing Belgian visas for the Fliegel family, their year spent in Antwerp, immigration to the United States, and difficulties in starting a new life and establishing a career in New York. The memoir includes recollections by Fliegel’s brother Fred (Fritz), biographical sketches of family members, family trees, and photocopies of Austrian, Belgian, and American records documenting Fliegel’s story.
