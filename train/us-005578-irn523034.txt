Bruno Stern's son, George, was a student at Penn State University when he received a cable from his brother saying, "Father is no longer at home." George knew that this meant that his father had been detained and sent to Buchenwald. As the result of George Stern's efforts, the University president "extended to [Dr. Bruno Stern] the privilege of attending seminars and research courses and of carrying on research in the laboratories and libraries." In addition, the U.S. State Department sent a letter to Germany which helped Dr. Bruno Stern and his wife, Frida, secure a U.S. visa, enabling them to escape Nazi Germany and immigrate to the United States.

The papers consist of a letter from Ralph Dorn Hetzel, president of Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania, on behalf of Dr. Bruno Stern's son George E. Stern, that helped Dr. Bruno Stern and his wife, Frida, escape from Nazi Germany to the United States where they joined their three sons. Also included is a photographic portrait of Dr. Bruno Stern.
