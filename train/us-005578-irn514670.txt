Simcha Elimelech Notowicz (Manius or Max Notowitz) was born Oct. 31, 1927, in Kolbuszowa, Poland to Osias and Ida Notowitz. Osias was the deputy to the head of the Kolbuszowa Jewish council, and perished in Auschwitz in 1941. Simcha was forced to work in the Kolbuszowa labor camp, but his mother and siblings, relocated to the Rzeszów ghetto, were deported to Bełzec in 1942. He managed to escape the labor camp in Nov. 1942 and spent the remainder of the war in the forests near Kolbuszowa. After liberation, he traveled to the American zone of Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1947.
