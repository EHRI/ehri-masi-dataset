Agricultural exhibition

Agricultural exhibition in the town of Radomyshl in the Zhitomir area of the Ukraine. For some reason, a map of Italy flashes for a split second, then cuts to a road sign reading "Radomyschl" (the German spelling). German officers, accompanied by farmers, walk about, inspecting farm equipment and machinery. Farmers look at model houses, signs advertising seed prices, and bundles of grain. VS, women and children looking at a demonstration on bee keeping and fish in glass tanks. Translation of Ukrainian narration: An agricultural-scientific exhibition is opened in Ukraine under German supervision. In a simple and easy to understand form it tells about the methods of improvement in different agricultural areas.
