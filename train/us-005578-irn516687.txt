Lilo Goldstone was born in 1938, to Alfred Heldenmuth (b. May 27, 1894, Wetzlar, Germany) and Selma Heldenmuth (b. July 14, 1908, Erfelden, Germany) in Clettenberg, Germany. The Heldenmuth owned a dairy farm. In 1939, the family boarded the MS St. Louis bound for Havana. After the ship returned to Europe, the Heldenmuth family disembarked in England. The family spent the war years in England and Wales. The family immigrated to the United States in 1945.

The Lilo Goldstone papers consist of five photographs of the Heldenmuth family. The photographs were taken at their home in Plettenberg, Germany; aboard the MS St. Louis; and after their arrival in England. There is also a piece of scrip issued to Alfred Heldenmuth at an English refugee center, and an obituary concerning the death of Solomon Heldenmuth in Germany.
