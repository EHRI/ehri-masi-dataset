Anti-Nazi caricature depicting animals with the faces of prominent Nazi leaders, published in Palestine in the early 1940s. If the instructions on the paper are followed, and the sheet is properly folded, the joined animals will create an image of Adolf Hitler. To escape persecution from the Nazis, many German and European Jews began immigrating to Palestine, which was awarded to Great Britain following World War I. Before and after the British takeover, successive waves of immigration (Aliyots) dramatically increased the regionâ€™s Jewish population. However, during this period of immigration, Britain placed strict limits on the number of Jews that could enter the country to ameliorate Arab concerns about the increasing Jewish immigration. During the war, thousands of Palestinian Jewish volunteers served in the British Army, and on September 14, 1944 a Jewish Brigade was established.
