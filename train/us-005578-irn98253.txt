This collection contains selected so-called “Zg.” files; that is, cases of declaring someone dead or issuing a death certificate. This includes those who perished during the Soviet or, mainly, Nazi occupation: including those arrested either by Soviets or Germans, deported to the USSR or the Third Reich, sent to concentration camps, murdered in ghettos or in other places of extermination. The files (app. 5-20 pages) contain an application declaring the death of a person, testimonies of two witnesses filled out on standard forms, and the correspondence and sentence of the court. The law determined who could be determined deceased (The law: Article 14, section 1): “Those who perished while participating in military operations can be declared deceased within a year after the end of the calendar year in which the military operations were over. The same refers to persons who perished while staying in the area under military operations if, according to the circumstances, it was likely that the missing was connected with these operations or under life threat.” That entry enabled one to lodge a file to find a person who was presumed deceased no earlier than the beginning of 1946.
