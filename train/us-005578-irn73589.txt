This collection contains selected files created by the County Prosecutor’s Office concerning Articles 1 and 2 of the decree of August 31, 1944 (“Sierpniówka”). These inquiries did not find their way to trial because the perpetrator could not be found, was found dead, or had escaped abroad, or the evidence was not sufficient to bring the case to the court, etc. The files of each case contains: information about the crime/offence, correspondence, protocols for arrest, protocols for search, protocols of inquiry of witnesses and suspects, motions of evidence and motions of inquiry, letters from the suspect and his family, decisions to discontinue the inquiry along with the justification, correspondence concerning the suspect’s release, death or disappearance. The “Sierpniówka” was one of the world's first legislation on liability for war crimes committed during World War II. This decree also applied to soldiers of the Home Army (Armia Krajowa) whom the Communist propaganda in the 40’s and 50’s attempted to portray as German collaborators.
