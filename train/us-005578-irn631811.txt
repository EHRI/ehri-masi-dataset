Gary Heymann (born Gerhard Heymann, 1923-2016) was born in Germany to Hartwig (1896-1993, son of Solms and Adele Heymann) and Helene (née Rosner, 1896-1981) Heymann. In 1934 Hartwig and Helene sent their son to Cleveland, Ohio via Hamburg. His parents fled Germany in 1938 to Amsterdam. Helene was able to get to England where she worked as a domestic. Hartwig survived the war in Trinidad. Gary served in the United States Army as one of the “Ritchie Boys,” German-speaking soldiers trained at Camp Ritchie in Maryland. He was reunited with his parents in the United States in 1946. After the war, Gary became a child psychologist. Both of Hartwig’s parents perished at Theresienstadt during the Holocaust.

The collection consists of photographs primarily depicting Nuremberg, Germany in 1936-1938 including Nazi rallies and party officials and the aftermath of Kristallnacht. Depictions of Nazi party members include Julius Streicher, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring, Rudolph Hess, and Joseph Goebbels. Post-Kristallnacht photographs include depictions of crowds, the destruction of a synagogue, SA men, and a Jewish boy being taken away. The collection also includes an itemized list by Gary Heymann sent to the Holocaust Library and Research Center Associates of San Francisco. The photographs were obtained by Gary Heymann, who served with the United States Army during World War II. Many of the photographs include annotation on the verso, presumably by Heymann.
