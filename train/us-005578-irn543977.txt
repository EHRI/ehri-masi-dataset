Malka Stavnichi and Edi Labe Chamysz lived in the small village of Verba (present day Verba, Ukraine). They had eight children, Jacob (1881-), Josef (1883-), Samuel (1889-), Anna, Pauline, Jenny, Clara, and Maryam (later Mary). All the daughters and their mother Malka immigrated to the United States by 1921. The brothers co-owned an apothecary in Lwów, Poland (present day Lviv, Ukraine), and remained in Europe. Jacob married Zesul Lerner and they had two daughters, Sonia and Edjya, and a son (name unknown). Josef married Zesul’s sister Leah Lerner, and they had one daughter, Edja. Samuel married Manya (last name unknown) and they had one son, Leon. It is likely that all three brothers and their families perished in the Holocaust. Gail Erlitz’s grandmother Mary's brothers were Jacob, Josef, and Samuel Chamysz.

The collection contains pre-war photographs of brothers Jacob, Josef, and Samuel Chamysz and their families in Lwów, Poland (present day Lviv, Ukraine). Also included is a letter with multiple authors dated 27 April 1921.
