Nazi propaganda poster, Wir - die Habenichtse!,[We the Have-Nots!] issued on January 13, 1941, for the Parole der Woche (Slogan of the Week] series. The text only poster explains how Britain has stolen by force most of the habitable land on earth. This is because their greedy leaders let the workers live in slums and garbage. But the German people need not worry because they, the have-nots, would win because they are fighting for their bread and will break the spines of these bloodsuckers. Parole der Woche was produced by the Nazi Party in Germany from 1936-1943. It was discontinued in 1943 because of paper shortages caused by the prolonged war.
