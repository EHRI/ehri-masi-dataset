Anti-semitic and anti-British propaganda

Excerpt from a propaganda film about the dangers of listening to foreign radio broadcasts. Sergeant Weber, a patient in a hospital, is admonished by a nurse for listening to a BBC broadcast. He begins to argue with her, but she assures him that he will feel better in the morning and leaves the room. She hears him turn on the radio again and stands outside the door, listening, as Weber tunes the radio to the BBC. As the radio music ends and an announcer's voice comes on, the nurse opens the door (she is silhouetted in the doorway) and says, "No, my dear! That is the Jew!" A "Jew" standing before a BBC microphone is superimposed onto the screen. The nurse's voice narrates over the first part of a scene showing a British man with a monocle in conversation with four men who are supposed to be German Jews. Switching from English to German, they discuss which false rumors about Germany they should start next. Shots of Germans pursuing their daily lives while the "Jews" discuss what Germans find important in life: they want to succeed at their jobs, have families, and for these goals they save their money (the visual is a bank statement from Dresdner Bank). The propagandists thus decide that the best course of action is to shake the faith of the German people in the stability of the Reichsmark and thereby cause inflation. The scene switches back to the hospital room, where the nurse asks Weber if he now sees clearly that behind all enemy propaganda stands the Jew. When he responds, "But this war has cost..." she cuts him off and says, "as long as we work and fight, the Jew cannot possibly devalue our currency." She warns him once again not to listen to enemy radio broadcasts, and the shame-faced Weber has obviously learned his lesson.
