Szymon Burg was born in Borislau, Austro-Hungarian Empire (later Borysław, Poland and Boryslav, Ukraine) in 1907, to Osias Burg (1860-1912) and Mina Burg, nee Rosenzweig (b. 1865), who were originally from Stanislau (later Stanislawow, Poland, and now Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine). Burg's parents moved to Vienna for education and professional training, but returned to Galicia, settling in Borysław, where Szymon and his siblings were raised. After his schooling, Szymon worked in the oil industry in companies based in and around Borysław, from 1920 to 1941. With the German invasion of this region in 1941, Burg and his family were forcibly resettled into a ghetto in Borysław, and then as forced laborers, working for a company called Karpathen Öl, until 1944. During this time Burg lost five of his siblings, who were murdered by the German forces. After liberation, Burg initially remained in Borysław, but later resettled in the Silesian city of Gliwice (Gleiwitz) after this region had been ceded by Germany to Poland, and Burg's native Galicia had been ceded to the Soviet Union. Burg married Eugenie Josefsberg (b. 1914), and they had a son, Stefan (b. 1946). Szymon worked in a construction firm in Gliwice until 1968, and he immigrated to Sweden the following year, settling in Malmö.
