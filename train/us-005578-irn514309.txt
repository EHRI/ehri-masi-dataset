Robert and Rose (Bruck) Lederer had two children, Nina (b. 1930) and Peter (b. ca. 1933). Robert died in a labor camp in Oranienburg. Rose and the children were sent to Terezin in September 1942, and from there were deported to their death in Auschwitz on May 15, 1944. Rose could have been selected with Nina for work, but she refused to abandon Peter and insisted that all three remain together. As a result, they all perished. Emily (Waldstein) Bruck (Rose's mother) perished in Terezin in 1945. Paul and Blanka (Bruck) Heller (Rose's youngest sister) rented a room from Mr. Blazek in Plana after Jews were no longer allowed to work in Czechoslovakia. When the Hellers were sent to Terezin in 1942, Mr. Blazek hid the Bruck family home movies, pictures, vase, and figurines. Paul never returned from the front with the Czech Army. Blanka survived Auschwitz and retrieved the family heirlooms. Blanka had a daughter, Gabrielle Reiter Rosberger.

Consists of photographs of the Lederer and Bruck families, circa 1938-1940, including photographs of Nina Lederova, whose watercolor is featured in "I Never Saw Another Butterfly." Also includes documentation for Mr. Kurt Reitler, who emigrated from Prague to Shanghai, including a 1940 Czech passport; receipts; identity cards; vaccination certification; and four multi-colored telegrams in Czech sending familial greetings.
