The International League against Racism and Antisemitism was founded in 1928 in Paris by Bernard Lecache and Pierre Parf. LICA is one of the oldest antiracism associations in the world. In 1934, its members numbered 8-10,000, and in 1938, 32,000. LICRA was the organization that took the most radical positions with regard to French and German antisemitism. Its representatives engaged street clashes with anti-Semitic groups and boycotted firms that did businesses with the Nazi Germany. LICA rejected the “policy of silence” practiced by the Consistory and other leading Jewish organizations. Beside individual members, the league included 60 institutional members; political parties, unions, and other organization that participated in its activities.
