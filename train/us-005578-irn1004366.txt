Roundup of Jews and Poles after the invasion of Poland

Shot of a group of civilian men arrested by the invading German troops. The narrator claims that they were involved in an atrocity against ethnic Germans in Bromberg [Bydgoszcz]. The soldiers search one of the men. Much-used shot of the man in a hat with his hands raised being marched across the street by German soldiers. A column of Polish prisoners under guard, including some Jews, walk along a road. The next shot shows Jews, some of them old men, being lined up against a wall. A group of religious Jews crowded into the open bed of a truck. The camera pans slowly along a line of religious Jews standing indoors. The commentary during these scenes is extremely antisemitic, including the statement that these Jews overran Germany after 1918 and that today their brothers and sons sit in England and France and agitate for war against the German people.
