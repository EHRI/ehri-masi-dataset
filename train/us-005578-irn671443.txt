The song was written by Zelik Barditshever (1898-1937), an itinerant teacher, poet, and playwright from Belts, Bessarabia (present-day Bălții, Moldava). Collected by the Yiddish writer Leibu Levin, it first appeared in a volume of Barditshever's works published in Czernowitz, Romania (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine) in 1939.
