Felicia Lubelczyk was born in Poland in 1900. She had three sisters, Hala Halina, born in 1903, Malgosia, and Laduriga. She was married to Seweryn Ehrlich vel Sluszny, born in 1899, the son of Mojshe Ehrlich, a wealthy factory owner. Seweryn had a position as a saleman in his family's business, but was a well known man about town, pursuing his favored pastimes, horseback riding and poker playing. The family lived in Warsaw and had 2 daughters, Irena, born in 1924, and Danuta, born in 1929. Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 and, by November 1940, the family was confined to the ghetto. Nineteen year old Irena escaped the ghetto in March 1943. She obtained false papers and lived in the Christian area of the city. On April 19, 1943, the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began, sparked by the increasing number of deportations to the concentration camps. It ended on May 16 and the ghetto was annihilated. Felicia's husband was killed during the insurrection. Felicia and Danuta managed to escape and were hidden for the remainder of the war by Juana Dylag and her husband, members of the underground Polish army. Following the end of the war in May 1945, Felicia and Danuta, were placed in Bindermichl displaced persons camp in Linz, Austria. They were reunited with Irena, who arrived at Bindermichl after learning that her family was there. Felicia's mother, Leokadia Lubelczyk, and many other family members were deported and, it is believed, killed in the concentration camps. Felicia and her daughters emigrated to New York on the transport ship, SS Marine Perch, in 1947, and settled in New York City. Felicia died in the Queens borough of New York City in 1983 at the age of 83.
