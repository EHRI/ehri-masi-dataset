In November 1918 the Polish government sent a delegation to Vienna with the task of establishing diplomatic relations with the Republic of Austria and coordinating the work of Polish liquidation units in the Austrian state. The delegation was not an official diplomatic representative, but formally fulfilled its role. In 1921 the delegation was renamed the Polish Embassy in Vienna. The organizational structure consisted of: the Diplomatic Department, the Consular Branch (in 1928 transformed into the independent consulate of the Republic of Poland in Vienna), the Military Department (abolished in 1922), the Commercial Division (later reduced to the position of commercial adviser), liquidation branch (around 1928), the Chancellery and the Office of the Rachid. At the moment of annexation of Austria by the German Reich in 1938 the Delegation was abolished.
