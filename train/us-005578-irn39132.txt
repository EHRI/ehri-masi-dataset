Consists of one memoir, 69 pages, entitled "Hindenburg--Aug 1944-January 1945" by Halina Den, originally of Radom, Poland. In the memoir, Ms. Den describes being taken from Auschwitz to Hindenburg, a newly opened forced labor camp housing both Jewish and Roma prisoners. She describes an SS officer named Muller and many of the other prisoners whom she names, as well as life at Hindenburg and the interactions between the Jewish and Roma prisoners. She describes being evacuated from Hindenburg by rail in January 1945 and, as the memoir ends, their arrival at Bergen-Belsen. Also includes a drawing of the layout of Hindenburg.
