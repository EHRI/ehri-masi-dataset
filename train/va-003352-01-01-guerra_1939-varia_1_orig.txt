The notes list measures that were undertaken by the Holy See Secretariat of State in favour of refugees and war prisoners. Lists of Polish prisoners were sent by apostolic nuncios in Lithuania and Romania; lists of Polish refugees were sent by apostolic nuncios in Latvia, Romania and Hungary. The apostolic nuncios in Germany replied that in the German Reich the Wehrmachtsauskunftsstelle für Kriegsverluste und Kriegsgefangene and the Red Cross are responsible for the issue. It also reports that charity organisations « Oeuvre des Prisonniers » in Lorient (France) and « Aide morale et matérielle aux prisonniers de guerre » are willing to cooperate. Special actions were undertaken in favour of Polish war prisoners, and the Holy See gave a financial contribution to the Polish Red Cross in order to send packs to deportees in German concentration camps.
