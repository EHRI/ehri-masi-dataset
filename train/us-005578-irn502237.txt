The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) is the world’s leading Jewish humanitarian assistance organization. The JDC was founded in 1914 to assist Jewish persons in Palestine during World War I. The Holocaust and World War II caused the JDC to ramp up its relief efforts. With the end of the war in 1945, Jewish survivors were placed into hastily created displaced persons camps throughout Europe. Along with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the JDC helped administer these camps and provide supplies. The JDC has aided millions of Jews in more than 85 countries.

Contains mainly correspondence of the AJDC Committees in Warsaw and Krakow with Jewish communities across Polish territory during German occupation (approximately 500 communities). Includes information about the committee’s administration, budgets and finance, activities of Jewish Councils in particular regions, Warsaw ghetto, emigration, charities. Included are name indexes of Jews asking families in USA and other countries for emigration papers; as well other name lists of distribution of help.
