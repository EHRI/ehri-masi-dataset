Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 05 David van Huiden Project 'Late gevolgen van Sobibor'

David van Huiden grew up in Amsterdam. His father died before his birth and when David was seven year old his mother remarried with the son of the chief rabbi of Groningen. The liberal Jewish family moved from the Concertgebouw district to Amsterdam Oost. For the children changes were far-reaching as their stepfather was a conservative Judaist. During the comprehensive Amsterdam roundup of 20 June 1943 David's parents got the idea of having David walk the dog in order to evade detention. Although the place was bristling with policemen David managed to reach friends of his stepfather's in another part of Amsterdam. During the rest of the war he was in hiding with two Frisian families. David's mother, stepfather, and sister were rounded up and murdered in Sobibor. David was taken in by a German Jewish family after the war. Toward the end of the fifties he met his wife, Liesbeth. Together they have two sons.
