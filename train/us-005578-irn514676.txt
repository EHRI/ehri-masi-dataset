Consists of 22 photographs seemingly taken by a SD-SIPO (Sicherheitspolizei) German soldier in Sosnowiec, Poland. The photographs show German soldiers interrogating and arresting Polish citizens, and possibly include photographs of the "Wehrfaehige," people who were capable of carrying arms who were interned during and after the Polish campaign as a security measure. The photographs were found after the war by Jacob Igra in an apartment in Sosnowiec.
