[Jews in Italy and Algeria]

1 electronic resource (42 pages)

The file contains two reports about Jews in Italy and Algeria in 1936. The reportrs are written in German and in French, published by the Jewish Central Information Office. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). This reports show how drasticly the situation in Italy and Algeria changed for Jews. In comparison to Germany the Jewish life in Italy was still good, but signs of a state-mandated anti-Semitism were visible and among other things, the proportion of Jewish leaders should be limited. The question have been asked why Jews in Italy were so passive, why they did not help themselves? Why they did not explain everyone that they were paying taxes, fulfilled their duties during war and in society, not because they wanted to achieve economic power, but only to fullfill their citizen duties. Further the report shows that also in Italy the propaganda machine was working, fascism versus Bolshevism and in both regimes Jews would have a bad standing.
