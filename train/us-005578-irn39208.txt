The Joe Van Rooyen collection consists of material related to the Holocaust experiences of Joe Van Rooyen, who was a member of the Dutch Resistance. In 1943, Van Rooyen was arrested and deported first to Amersfoort, and then to a labor camp near Berlin, where he worked for the Bamag-Meguin steel factory. He describes being tortured for information. Mr. Van Rooyen was liberated by the American Army in April 1945. Includes Mr. Van Rooyen's handwritten memoir (with typed transcript), three audiocassettes containing an oral history with Mr. Van Rooyen, a magazine containing an article about him, his identity card from 1941, a 1949-1951 blood donation card, and his 1943 work pass for Bamag-Meguin. Also includes two photographs of Mr. Van Rooyen as well as photographic negatives of an unknown concentration camp.
