Salli Joseph (1886-1943) was born in Neuenbürg, Germany to Manne and Dorothea (née Danziger) Joseph. He served in World War I with the German Army, and earned the Iron Cross. After the war, he married Martha Danziger (1886-1943) and they settled in Berlin, Germany where they ran a tailoring business in their home. They had two children, Bernard (1920-1997) and Margot (1924-; later Margot Hamburger). Margot attended public schools until 1934, and then attended a Jewish school. She became a Zionist while in school and began planning to immigrate to Palestine. She joined Youth Aliyah in 1939, and on 25 March 1940 she sailed on the Marco Polo out of Trieste, Italy to Haifa, Palestine. She worked on a kibbutz called Ramat David for a little over two years. She would later work as a mail carrier and telephone operator. She was able to keep in contact with her parents, and received additional information about them through relatives and the International Red Cross. In October 1943, she learned from an aunt in the United States that her parents had been deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. She learned after the war that they were killed shortly after their arrival to the camp. She married Egon Hamburger (1913-1968) in 1950 in Israel, and they had two children. They immigrated to the United States in 1954. Bernard was able to get a work permit for England, and left Germany in 1939. He was sent to an internment camp in Tatura, Australia around 1941, and was sent back to England around 1943, where he settled in Leeds. He married Ruth Hilda Loew (1912-1985), also a Jewish refugee from Berlin, in 1944, and they immigrated to the United States after the war.
