Visit to Ukraine by Soviet writer Marietta Shaginyan

Marietta Shaginyan (1888-1982): Soviet writer and Lenin Prize winner, was an artist with broad philosophical and social views. Her collections of verse, plays, adventure stories ("Mess-Mend" 1923-1925), and a novel ("Hydroelectric Plant", 1931) were written after Shaginyan had lived quite some time at the construction site of the Dzor Power Station in Armenia. She also wrote the "Ulyanov Family tetralogy" (1937-1968) about V.I. Lenin, various articles, literary portraits, and memoirs ("The Man and the Times", 1980).

"Soviet Ukraine"- Release 43. Soviet writer, Marietta Shaginyan, biographer of Lenin, visits the Ukraine. Speech to Dykanka kolhoz youth (members of a collective farm group) in Armenian or Russian (not certain of language of speech as this story is accompanied by voiceover narration in Ukrainian, and the original sound of the speech is not heard, and was perhaps never recorded). Translation of Ukrainian narration: Narration about the writer: Youth from Dykanka kolgosp [Ukrainian translation of 'kolhoz'] in the Poltava Region welcome the honored writer Marietta Shaginyan. The writer took under her patronage "comsomoles" [younger members of the Communist Party] that responded to Stalin's call and are now going to work at railway transport. This demonstrates a very close relationship between writers and their audience of millions of Soviet readers. Intertitle: "Meeting with a writer."
