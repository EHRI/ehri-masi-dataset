Aprónyomtatványok gyűjteménye

The collection of placards and other small printed material is based on the collections of the Hungarian Auschwitz Foundation (HFA), an NGO established in 1990 by survivors to collect and preserve documentation pertaining to the Holocaust. HFA collected copies of archival material from several Hungarian public collections as well as original private documents donated by other institutions and individuals. The collection was handed over to the newly established Holocaust Memorial Center in 2004. From that time on, the collection has grown due to the donations of individuals.

The placards, leaflets and other kinds of printed material of this collection were created by various organizations and institutions, mostly by Hungarian right-wing and extreme right-wing parties and movements. Besides, the publications and various kinds of printed material, including placards and brochures issued by the Holocaust Memorial Center and its predecessors between 1990 and 2010 are also held in this collection.
