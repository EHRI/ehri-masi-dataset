Papers re Dr Otto Ernst Schueddekopf of the Hielscher Group

c21 frames

The 'Hielscher Group' was named after Friedrich Hielscher, an anti-Nazi, who encouraged those sympathetic to his cause to oppose the Nazis from within the party. He was arrested after the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. Otto-Ernst Schüddekopf, the depositor, in a covering letter at the beginning of the collection, describes himself as a former member of the Hielscher group, who, in the last 3 years of the war, was active in the foreign affairs section of the <i>SS</i> press office. This, he claims, gave him the opportunity to help Jewish members of the group to escape persecution by the Nazis.
