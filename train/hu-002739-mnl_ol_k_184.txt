Besides the anti-Semitic laws introduced in Hungary in the late 1930s and early 1940s that were of a more general scope, there was also a more specific initiative to reduce the involvement of Jews in the sphere of agriculture with the aim of excluding them from the Hungarian soil. This drive found its major legal expression in law XV. of 1942, also called the fourth Jewish law. The collection titled General Records of the Ministry of Agriculture (1889-1944) contain the papers that were created during the operation of the chief departments of the Ministry of Agriculture. The papers have been selected several times but it seems that only operational questions have influenced what was selected and destroyed. The papers from the years 1913 to 1944 were only selected under the control and supervision of the Hungarian National Archive after 1950 and their largest part has thus survived. Besides operational papers, all papers that are of economic or even historical significance have been preserved and enable researcher to study the anti-Semitic radicalization in the sphere of agriculture as it was documented in the records of the Ministry of Agriculture.
