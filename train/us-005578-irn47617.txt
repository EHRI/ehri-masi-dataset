Judith Sleed (née Weinberger) was born in 1932 to Pál and Margit Weinberger. She had one sibling Tamàs (Tomi). She survived the Holocaust as a hidden child in Budapest, but her entire family perished.

Consists of pre-war photographs of Pál and Margit Weinberger, and their children, Tamàs (Tomi) and Judith, as well as members of their extended family. Also includes a play entitled "Delibab-Utca" by Judith Weinberger in which she fictionalized her experiences as an orphan in post-war Budapest and as an adult, reflecting on her life and experiences. Weinberger survived in hiding in Budapest and was the only survivor of her family.
