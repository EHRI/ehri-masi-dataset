Grossbard family: Correspondence

8 folders

This collection comprises correspondence from the friends and family of Siegfried Grossbard, a Jewish refugee from Vienna who eventually became resident in Great Britain. Much of the material was used by Michael Gordon, the depositor and son of Siegfried, in his history of his father's experience of the Nazi years <em> Plaything of Destiny</em> [Wiener Library OSP 497]. The latter provides a full history of the family and a commentary on the correspondence. Not all of the correspondence referred to in <em> Plaything of Destiny</em> is held within this collection. In particular there are no letters from the Grossbard brothers whilst inmates of Dachau and Buchenwald in 1938.</div><br>
