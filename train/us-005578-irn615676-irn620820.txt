I'm An American -- Ludwig Bemelmans

On February 9, 1941 Ludwig Bemelmans spoke with William H. Marshall, Assistant District Director of Immigration at Ellis Island, about his American experience. Bemelmans begins by telling Mr. Marshall why he’s proud to be an American. The two men discuss Ludwig’s first impression and misconceptions. The author states the difference between German and American culture is discipline. He goes on to tell a humorous story to strengthen his claim. The author explains why naturalized citizens boast of their native land, but are still loyal to America. He gives his opinion on the current state of Europe. Bemelmans closes the program telling a story about the time he was scheduled to interview Hitler. Ludwig Bemelmans was born on April 27, 1898 in Meran, Austria-Hungary (now Italy). In 1904, his father left the family for another woman. His mother moved the family to her native town in Regensburg, Germany. He hated German schooling and was often bullied for his small stature. At 16, Bemelmans apprenticed with his uncle in an Austrian hotel. He ran into trouble, however, after he shot the head waiter in the abdomen for continuously whipping him. His family was advised by the police to send him to reform school or America. Bemelmans arrived in America on Christmas Eve 1914 and joined the U.S. Army in 1917, but was not deployed to Europe because of his German roots. Bemelmans became a naturalized citizen while serving. The aspiring author then spent several years exclusively writing and painting while working at the Ritz-Carlton. Bemelmans began publishing children’s books after meeting May Massee, a children’s book editor, in the 1930s. Bemelmans’ breakout book "Madeline" was published in 1939.
