Beno Rattner (1912-1993) was born August 8, 1912 to Moses (1885-1942) and Rosa Rattner (1891-1942). Documents list his birthplace at either Stanislau, Poland (now Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine) or Vienna, Austria. He made his way to England and enlisted in the British Army in May 1940. Beno met and married Edith Breindler in England in 1940, immigrated to Canada around 1947, and settled in Montreal. His parents were deported from Vienna on April 27, 1942 to Włodawa, near the Sobibor killing center, on transport number 27 and never returned. The transport was initially destined for Izbica. Most of the Jewish deportees from this transport were murdered at the Sobibor or Belzec killing centers in June and October 1942.

Edith Rattner (1920-2004) was born Edith Breindler on May 20, 1920 in Vienna to Rubin (1884-1942) and Anna Breindler (1896-1942). Edith and her sisters Jenny and Sonja were sent to England on a Kindertransport and worked as domestics. Rubin and Anna Breindler were deported from Vienna on May 12, 1942 to the Izbica ghetto in Lublin District on transport number 20 and never returned. Most of the Jewish deportees from this transport were murdered at the Belzec killing center in June and October 1942.

The Rattner and Breindler families papers consist of biographical materials and correspondence documenting the families of Beno Rattner and Edith Breindler in Vienna, the couple’s lives and marriage in England, and their parents’ unsuccessful efforts to emigrate. Biographical materials include Beno’s German passport, two of Edith’s British passports, birth and registration records, Beno’s World War II military papers, and certificates documenting the deportation of Beno’s parents. Most of the correspondence is addressed to Beno and Edith in England from their parents in Vienna. The letters ask for updates about their children’s lives in England, provide news about life in Vienna, and share information about continuing emigration efforts.
