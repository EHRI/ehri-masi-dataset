German munitions

Panning shot of German heavy and light weapons for use on the front. Emphasis on the numbers and might of the tanks and weaponry. Close-up of tanks wheels rolling past as the narrator reports that the Soviets are being decisively defeated on all parts of the front, and that neither "General mud nor General winter" can stop the German advance. Vehicles of all types rolling along the road. Low aerial shot of the convoy along the road with triumphant music.
