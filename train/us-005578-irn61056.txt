Franz Robert Hollo was born on September 8, 1930 in Vienna, Austria. When he was still a child, his family emigrated to Hungary and lived in Debrecen. In June 1944, he obtained false papers and went into hiding in Gyömrő and in Pilis, Hungary. He was liberated by the Soviet Union.

Annette Drechsler was born on June 20, 1933 in Paris, France. In 1941, her father was arrested and taken to Drancy; he was deported to Auschwitz in 1942 where he perished. Annette's mother obtained false papers and put Annette in hiding, first in a boarding school in Vincennes, France, and then with a Christian family. She and her mother reunited right before the liberation of Paris.

Consists of short descriptions of the wartime experiences of Franz Robert Hollo, originally of Vienna, Austria, and Annette Drechsler Hollo, originally of Paris, France. The Hollos both spent part of the war in hiding--Franz in Hungary in 1944 and Annette in France from 1942-1944--as well as a photograph of Franz and his sister Veronica in 1939 and a copyprint of Annette, circa 1941.
