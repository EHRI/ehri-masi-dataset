Porunca Vremii was one of the leading Iron Guard newspapers in Romania. This number was published seventeen days after the Iron Guard coup led by Gen. Ion Antonescu. The article, "Un asn dela Pedepsirea lui Armand Calinescu," (One Year after the Punishment of Armand Calinescu), concerns the former Minister of the Interior and Prime Minister under King Carol of Romania, Armand Calinescu, who was executed by the Iron Guard as revenge for the reprisals (especially the extrajudicial execution of C.Z. Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard) against the Iron Guard.
