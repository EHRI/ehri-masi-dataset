Otto Wilhelm (Willi, 1889-1944?) and Erna Dora Dublon (née Beerman, 1903-1944?) had two daughters, Lore (1927-1994?) and Eva (1933-1944?). The family lived in Erfurt, Germany where Willi owned Salamander Schuhe, a local shoe store and Erna was a housewife. In 1938 the family applied for visas to the United States. The family booked passage to Cuba where they could safely to wait until they received their American visas. They sailed to Cuba aboard the MS St. Louis in May 1939. Erich Dublon (1890-1942), Willi’s brother, also sailed with them. After being denied entry to Cuba and the United States, the family disembarked in Belgium, where Erna had relatives. On August 8, 1942, Erich Dublon was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp where he perished on September 3, 1942. The rest of the Dublon family was held at the Mechelen transit camp before deported to Auschwitz concentration camp on transport XXIII on January 15, 1944. They were assigned transport prisoner numbers: Willi, 675; Erna, 698; Lore, 699; Eva, 700. Eva and her parents likely perished at Auschwitz concentration camp around 1944 or 1945. Records show that Lore Dublon was sent to Auschwitz and then to Golleschau, a sub-camp of Auschwitz, where she likely perished.
