Included are documents issued to Helena Babijczuk and used by Maria to obtain false documents in the name of Helena Babijczuk Keck, allowing her to pass as a Roman Catholic. Also included is post-war documentation illustrating her chronology during the war in Piaseczno and Lvov, Poland; her experiences and those of her mother, Stella Menkes, who was killed in the Katyn massacre in Poland in 1940; and the experiences of her brother, who was also on false papers under the name Stefan Keck, who was arrested and by the Nazis for resistance activity and executed on December 2, 1943 in Warsaw, Poland in retaliation for an unrelated November 26, 1943 attack on the Order Police in Warsaw.
