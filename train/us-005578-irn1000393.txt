Funeral and procession; ritual slaughter; synagogue

Elaborate funeral: Body lying in state, many plantings and flowers, guards. Taking up the width of the street, the funeral procession includes Jewish police, rabbis in robes, horse-drawn hearse, mourners with banners. At cemetery, lowering casket, service, shots of mourners (three rabbis chanting, one woman completely draped in black). Microphone can be seen on left side, briefly, held above the mourners and grave markers, 01:59:24. Synagogue service: Worshippers pray. Torah is removed from the ark, men kiss it, then read from it. Shochet: In kosher style, kills chicken while woman watches (very dark interior). Jewish men at prayer: Man kisses and lays on tallit, winds on phylacteries, then davens (prays). VAR shots of orthodox men at prayer: Standing, draped in tallit, bowing (some CU). In prayer-study, group of younger orthodox men and boys (with earlocks, beards) pray across long table.
