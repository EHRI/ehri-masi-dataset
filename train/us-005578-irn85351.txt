Schmil Prutzki (sometimes spelled Smil Pritzki or Prutchi), his parents, sister Betia (Becca) and a third child were sent from their home in Romania to Transnistria where they were forced to work in salt mines and were sent on a death march. Schmil and Betia were the only survivors of their immediate family. After the war, they went to Israel and from there eventually immigrated to South America to join their extended family. Mina Goodman was the oldest of nine children and Shmil was her nephew. Mina and Harry had immigrated to the United States with their two children Bessie and Izy in 1924.
