Štátny archív v Bratislave, Pobočka Modra

Consists of World War II-era administrative files from the district archives in Modra and the wider Bratislava region. It includes reports, lists, and propaganda leaflets. Topics include Gestapo members and activities in occupied Czechoslovakia, the Hlinka Guard, the Sudetendeutsche Partei, the use of Nazi symbols and greetings, pro-and anti-Communist movements, and the writings of prominent individuals. A large part of the material pertains to antisemitic measures: the confiscation of Jewish property and the distribution of Jewish assets among Hlinka Guard members; prohibitions against Jews practicing medicine or employing Christians in their homes; bans on Jews entering Slovakia; Jewish labor camps; the inspection of Jewish homes and the seizure of radio receivers; reporting on the activities of Jews in Hungary; and controls against false passports and baptismal certificates. There are also presidential exemptions allowing skilled Jews to remain in their jobs.
