Consists of an English-language, typed translation of Pauline Widder Fabri's memoir, which she wrote immediately after the war, in Budapest, Hungary. She describes her experiences between March 1944 and the end of the war, focusing particularly on the dates between November 16, 1944 and January 18, 1945, as she took detailed notes of her activities between those dates. She describes the anti-Jewish ordinances established after the German invasion, her move into the area of Budapest protected by Raoul Wallenberg and the Swedish embassy, her daily activities in the winter of 1944- 1945, and her memory of the liberation of Budapest by the Russian army. The memoir was translated from Hungarian into English by Mrs. Fabri's son, Paul, in 1986.
