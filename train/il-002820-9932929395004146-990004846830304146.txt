This file contains a letter written on the 28th of June 1933 by the head of the Bern police Ad. Stauffer. He responds to a letter written by the SIG (Swiss Israelite Community) on the 19th of June concerning the publishing of the Protocols in a Swiss newspaper. In his answering letter he responds that the police can't do something about the publishing at the moment but advises the SIG to go to court and address the problem directly to the judge in order to classify the Protocols under "trashy literature" (Schundliteratur).
