Judith Popinski (born Judyta Zachariasz) on August 5, 1923 in Łódź, Poland. Her father, Gecel Zachariasz, was a textile engineer and her mother, Fajga Rywa (Regina) Talmud Zachariasz took care of Judyta and her younger brother, Jakób, (b. 1927). In 1939 the family was forced into the Lodz ghetto. Gecel died in 1941 and Jakób contracted typhus and died in 1942. On August 17, 1944, during the liquidation of the ghetto, Judith and her mother were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Fajga Rywa was killed on arrival and Judith was transferred to several slave labor camps including Berlin-Neukoelln, Sachsenhausen, and Ravensbrück. On April 26, 1945 Judith and 500 other women prisoners were handed over to the Swedish and Danish Red Cross and transferred to Sweden. After the war Judith married a fellow survivor from Łódź, Abram Popinski in July 1946.

The collection consists of four photographs of Judit Popinski (born Judyta Zachariasz) and her family while in the Łódź ghetto, Poland.
