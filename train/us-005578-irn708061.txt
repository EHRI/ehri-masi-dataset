Bernard Makover (1869-1946) was born in Plock, Poland to Aaron Makover and Rachael Lowenberg (d. 1930) and had seven siblings including Mina (b. 1872 in Warsaw), Joachim, Thomas (b. 1890?), Francine (later Grossbarg), and Regina. Bernard immigrated to the United States in 1890 and became a naturalized citizen in 1892. He married Rose Sworzga (1878-1936, born in Poland to Morris and Annie) in 1895 and they had four children, Abraham (b. 1896), Isadore (b. 1897), Gertrude, and Henry. Bernard and his family lived in Baltimore where he worked for a clothing company. While visiting his family in Poland in 1934 he attempted to help them leave with him, but he was unsuccessful. His brother, Thomas, immigrated to the United States in 1910 and two other sisters immigrated soon after. Francine was sent on a Kidertransport. The rest of his family perished during the war.

The collection includes a typewritten diary by Bernard Makover documenting his trip to Europe in 1934. During his trip he dictated his entries to his secretary, Julius Grossbart. In the diary Bernard describes his time aboard the SS Conte di Savoia to Italy, the train ride from Italy to Poland, the political situation in Poland, his time spent with his extended family, and his trip back to New York aboard the SS Rex. While in Poland he tried to help bring family members back to the United States with him, but was unsuccessful.
