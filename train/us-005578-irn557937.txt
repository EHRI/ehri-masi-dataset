In the final phase of World War I, the Polish interests of the French government were represented by the representative of the Polish National Committee, the official diplomatic mission. The Polish Envoy was established in 1919 on the basis of the former agencies of the Committee. In 1924 the institution was elevated to the rank of the Polish Embassy. During World War II, following the defeat of France and its subsequent occupation by German forces, the embassy was evacuated in the autumn of 1940, and there was an exchange of diplomatic representatives between the Polish government in exile and the Free France Committee in July 1943. The French National Liberation Committee was established in Algiers, where the Polish Embassy (since 1944 - Embassy of the Republic of Poland) was established. After the liberation of Paris from the German occupation, the institution was transferred to the French capital.
