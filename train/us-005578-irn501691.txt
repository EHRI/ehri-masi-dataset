Consists of one typed portion of a memoir, 37 pages, entitled "80574" written by Simha Naor, born Stella Silberstein, 1899-1994, originally of Vienna, Austria. In the memoir, which was written based on the diary she began immediately after liberation, Simha describes her arrest in southern France in 1943, her deportation to Drancy and almost immediately thereafter, to Auschwitz. She describes the process of arriving at Auschwitz, the architecture of the barracks, and life with fellow prisoners. The memoir, which is incomplete, contains a preface by Tisa von der Schulenburg. The original German language transcript of the complete memoir is located in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Library and in the Archives, and is entitled "Krankengymnastin in Auschwitz: Aufzeichnungen des Haftlings, Ausgabe 80574."
