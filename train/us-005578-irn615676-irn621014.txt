I'm An American -- Frank Kingdon

On June 29, 1941 Dr. Frank Kingdon spoke with William H. Carmichael, District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, about why he is devoting his time to national defense. Dr. Kingdon reveals he came to America because he believes there was more opportunity for individualism. He shares his immigration story. He says he has always thought of America as home. Dr. Kingdon adds, “If America today has a foreign problem, it doesn't rise from the mixed population. But from out of date beliefs that there are any foreign nations and foreign people in this modern age.” Dr. Kingdon refers to the planet as one big city because the radio allows many people to listen to one man’s voice. He warns of the most dangerous influences coming from outside the country’s borders. Dr. Kingdon explains the changes of democracy over the years. Dr. Frank Kingdon (b. Francis Kingdon Ward) was born on November 6, 1885 in Manchester, England. He and his family emigrated to America the same year.
