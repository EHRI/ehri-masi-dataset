"Jurban Sujovole"

The Destruction of Sukhovoliye: In Memory of a Jewish Town Between Bialistok and Grodno

Symche Lazar was born in Suchowold, Poland on February 28, 1907. This small Jewish community was destroyed by the German Nazi in 1942, and Symche was the only member of his family to survive the pogroms. While in a camp in Italy in 1946, he wrote a booklet describing "the destruction and elimination of the Jewish people in the area of Bialystok and Grodno in Poland", and documenting "the names and ranks of the [Nazi] officers relating what they did and where they did it." Information from this book was later used to prosecute the Nazi war criminals. Symche Lazar immigrated to the U.S. in 1950.
