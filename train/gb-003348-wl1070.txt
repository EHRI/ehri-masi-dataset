Dann family papers and the records of Bulldogs Bank

1 box

Only one part of this collection was ever formally accessioned: secondary material on the history of the Jews in Augsburg at 1070/4. The rest came from Sophie Dann via Christa Wichmann as multiple deposits over the course of a decade from the early 1980s.

Bulldog Bank was a house in Sussex which was bought by a wealthy philanthropist, Lady Clarke, for the purpose of caring for the youngest concentration camp orphans who came to this country in the immediate post war period. Sophie and Gertrud Dann worked at both the Hampstead Nursery and Bulldog Bank.

This collection comprises two separate, though linked, archival fonds. The papers at 1070/1-4 record the lives of the Dann family, a renowned Augsburg Jewish family. Documents relating to Sophie and Gertrud Dann, the depositors of this collection, feature most prominently.<br /><br />At 1070/5 are papers which document the history and activities of the Hamstead Nursery and Bulldog Bank. For an account of the sisters' work there see some of the autobiographical accounts in the personal papers of Sophie Dann at 1070/3.
