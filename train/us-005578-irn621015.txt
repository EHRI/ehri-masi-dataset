I'm An American -- Richard Waring

On July 6, 1941 Richard Waring spoke with Ugo Carusi, Executive Assistant to the Attorney General, about what it means to be a foreign-born citizen. Waring shares his immigration story. He talks about his latest role and how it relates to democracy. He compares the personalities of American and British citizens. Waring states anyone who has enjoyed the privileges of a democracy has a responsibility to vote. He references the irony in how people, who are hereditary enemies in Europe, manage to live peacefully as neighbors and work together in America. Carusi states, “Intolerance always precedes the loss of other liberties”. Waring validates his statement by referencing how and why America was formed. The segment ends with the actor reading a passage from the writings of Abraham Lincoln about the pioneering spirit of democracy. Richard Waring (b. Richard Waring Stephens) was born on May 27, 1910 in Buckinghamshire, England. His father, Thomas E. Stephens, painted the presidential portrait of Dwight. D. Eisenhower. Waring made his stage debut in 1931, when he was cast in minor roles. He became a naturalized citizen in 1937, changing his legal name to Richard Waring. He was scheduled to star alongside Hollywood starlet Bette Davis, but he entered the Army during World War II. Richard Waring went on to star in numerous Broadway shows and films.
