1 folder

Apart from the second item (1124/2), nothing is known of the custodial history of these papers. Nothing is known of the fate of the individuals to whom the documents refer.

This is a collection of copy documents, the common theme of which is antisemitic discrimination practised by the nazis with particular reference to the professions. Medicine, dentistry, the law, the theatre and retail are all represented.
