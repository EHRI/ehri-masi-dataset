Kitchener Camp, Richborough, Kent: Records

1 box, 1 album, 2 folders

The Kitchener camp, a derelict site which had previously been an army camp, was taken over by the Council for German Jewry at the beginning of 1939 as a result of pressure from the <em>Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland</em> to rescue threatened Jews from Germany and Austria. Conditions for admission were that inmates must be aged between 18 and 40 and that they have a definite prospect of emigration overseas. The camp began receiving refugees in February 1939 and ended with the outbreak of war in September after which most of the inmates chose to enlist in the British army.

The documents in this collection offer an insight into the day to day lives of the inmates of the Kitchener Camp for refugees near Sandwich at Richborough, Kent in 1939.
