Herman worked for the Jewish council in Rotterdam. Herman was arrested and sent to Westerbork on March 6, 1943. Marie, Frits, Martijn, and Martha were sent to Westerbork on May 6, 1943; Carola, who was living with the Den Hartogh family in Amsterdam, was arrested later and joined her family at the camp. The youngest child, Martha, died in Westerbork on June 6, 1943. The rest of the family was deported to Theresienstadt in February 1944, where Herman died in April. Marie and the children were sent to the Czech family camp in Birkenau on May 16, 1944 and were killed when the family camp was liquidated on July 7, 1944.
