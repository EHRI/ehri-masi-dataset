The couple moved to Istanbu,l hoping to immigrate to Brazil, but when this did not work, they went to Palestine and lived in a refugee camp for a year. Igor obtained a job in Rhodesia, and the couple moved there, living in a refugee camp until Igor got a new job in a meat packing company producing spam for the British Army. Igor bought a cattle farm near Nairobi and became quite wealthy. He became very prominent within the Kenyan community and the couple remained there for the rest of their lives.
