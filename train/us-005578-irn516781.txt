The collection consists of two photographs documenting the Reznikov or Reznikova family in Voznesensk, Ukraine. The first photograph depicts a large group of men and women, including Sura Reznikova, gathered around a man reading a document. The second photograph depicts Lia and Natful Reznikov. The description on the verso of both photographs states in part “…perished by Nazi in 1941.”
