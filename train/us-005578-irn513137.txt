Dora Levy was born on January 3, 1928, to Sarina (Perahia) and Salomon Izhak Levy. She was raised in Salonika (ThessalonikeÌ„), Greece. In 1942, the Levy family was forced to relocate to one of the ghettos that the Germans had established in Salonika. After being warned of the impending deportations to Auschwitz, the Levys went into hiding in Athens in 1943. They remained there until 1946 when they were finally able to return to Salonika. In 1947, Dora married Salomon Saltiel, a childhood friend who had been a prisoner of war during World War II. The couple emigrated to the United States in 1955.

The papers consist of documents; identification cards; newspaper clippings; a CD of memoirs, family photographs, and a family tree related to the Levy family of Thessaloniki (Salonika), Greece. The documents relate to life under the German occupation, forced labor as Jews, and life in the Salonika ghetto. After being warned of upcoming deportations, the Levys went into hiding in Athens, where they spent the remainder of the war. The collection also relates to Salomon Saltiel, who was a member of the Greek military and spent the war in Italian and German POW camps. He and Dora Levy married in 1947.
