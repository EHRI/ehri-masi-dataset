Helen H. Waterford is a native of Offenbach, Germany, and a survivor of Auschwitz. Waterford and her first husband were hidden by non-Jews in Amsterdam, Netherlands, during most of the Nazi occupation but were discovered by the Gestapo and taken to Auschwitz where her husband died. She was later moved to Kratzau (a.k.a. Chrastava) concentration camp. After liberation, Waterford and her daughter emigrated to the United States. In 1979 she began lecturing to audiences about her experiences during the Holocaust. Waterford presently resides in Chula Vista, California.

Consists of the original manuscript of "Commitment to the Dead: One Woman's Journey Towards Understanding" (251 pages) and a revised first draft (139 pages) of the same by Helen H. Waterford. The manuscript is Helen Waterford's personal testimony of persecution and suffering during her imprisonment in Auschwitz and Kratzau (a.k.a. Chrastava). Inserted into the text are questions and comments for Waterford's many lectures. Both the original manuscript and first draft are marked heavily with notations by an editor.
