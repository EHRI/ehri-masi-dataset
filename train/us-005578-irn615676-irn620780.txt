I'm An American -- Louis Adamic

On August 10, 1940, Louis Adamic spoke with Mr. Shawnessy, Deputy Commissioner of the Immigration Service about his hopes for immigrants coming to America. The passionate political writer believes that many newcomers arrive with a common purpose of freedom and opportunity; therefore they possess the American spirit long before they arrive. Adamic goes on to define and explain “Americanism”. He believes immigration to America has drained Europe of those “who had the will to defend freedom in their homelands.” The author also warns it is not enough to be appalled by the actions of Hitler and the Nazi Party. He suggests that Americans summon emotion and take action. Adamic shares his plan to revive the American Dream. He suggests self-awareness, genuine interest in immigrants and avoidance of suspicion. Louis Adamic (b. Alojz Adamič) was born on March 23, 1898 in Praproče pri Grosupljem (present day Slovenia), Austria-Hungary to a middle class family. His interest and participation in political activities caused him to be expelled from grade school in Ljubljana. In 1913, 15-year-old Adamic emigrated to New York. He joined the U.S. Army three years later and became a naturalized citizen during his service. After leaving the military, Adamic settled in California. He became nationally known as a journalist and writer who advocated for American minorities, especially immigrants. Adamic wrote about the failed American melting pot in Laughing in the Jungle (1932); as well as autobiography in My America (1937). From 1940 to 1942, he served as the founding editor of Common Ground, a pro-immigrant quarterly. Adamic died in 1951 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Some wonder, however, if he was murdered because of his political views.
