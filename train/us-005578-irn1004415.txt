Hungary and Yugoslavia sign treaty

Hungary and Yugoslavia sign a friendship treaty. Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Csaky arrives by train in Belgrade for the signing of the treaty. The platform is decked with flags and Yugoslav soldiers stand at attention. Csaky is greeted by his Yugoslav counterpart, Aleksandar Cincar-Markovic. The two walk down the platform together. The next scene shows Csaky exiting the Hungarian embassy, presumably after signing the treaty. He stands with a group of people, including several women, and smiles at the camera beside a bouquet of flowers. 01:01:33 A few seconds of the next part of this newsreel (Not ordered by USHMM)
