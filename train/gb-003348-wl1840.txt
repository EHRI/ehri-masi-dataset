Tony Berger (born 1919) originally came from Duisburg where she lived with her mother Anna Berger, her younger sister Lotti (born 1926) and her brother Max (c1923-1945). She was the only person in the family to obtain permission to emigrate to England on a domestic visa in 1939. Her boyfriend, Walter, also emigrated to London but later moved to New York. She stayed with a family in Cricklewood and earned a living doing domestic work. Her grandparents were planning to go to Palestine but could only get permits to live with relatives in Poland in July 1939. They did not survive the Holocaust. Tony's mother, sister and brother did not manage to obtain all the documentation required for emigration in time before the outbreak of the war.&nbsp;<div><span style="line-height: 1.22;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.22;">Max Berger was arrested in September 1939 but released shortly after.
