Katie Miller accompanied her husband, Rabbi Joseph Miller, to Germany and Austria in the summer of 1946. Her husband studied to be a rabbi at a yeshiva in Chicago at the same time he was pursuing a law degree at De Paul University. After completing his studies, he volunteered to serve as a chaplain with the U.S. Army, and was assigned to serve in occupied Austria and Germany. Mrs. Miller worked with refugees in displaced persons camps in and around Linz, Austria, and both she and her husband eventually chose to help some of these refugees travel through parts of British-occupied Germany in order to reach ports from which they could travel to Palestine, in an operation known as "Aliyah Bet." Mrs. Miller documented these activities in photographs that she took, and later organized in a photo album, after her return to the United States.

One photograph album, containing 67 prints, depicting displaced persons camps operated by UNRRA in and around Linz, Austria, 1946-1947. Also contains 25 loose snapshots depicting Holocaust memorials in Germany, concentration camp sites, aid workers, and activities to smuggle Jewish refugees out of Europe to Palestine.
