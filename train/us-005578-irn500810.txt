John Franklin (1930- ) was born Hans Frankenthal in Würzburg to Max Frankenthal (1886-1945) and Klara Frankenthal (nee Frankenthaler, 1899-1988). His family sought refuge in The Hague, Netherlands, in 1938 and relocated to 's-Hertogenbosch following the German invasion in 1940. He survived the Jewish ghetto in Amsterdam, was deported to Westerbork in 1943, and transferred to Bergen-Belsen later that year. He and his father were evacuated on the so-called "Lost Train" that was headed for Theresienstadt but ended up near the little German town of Tröbitz. His father died on the train. After the war, he was reunited with his mother (who had survived Auschwitz) and grandmother (who had survived in hiding). He and his mother immigrated to the United States in 1947, joined his mother’s relatives in San Francisco, and changed their name to Franklin.
