Consists of approximately 137 pre-war photographs of Buczacz and Lvov, Poland. Many of the photographs are of Helena Maria Erlich (later Falik, and subsequently Wieteska) and her family. Helena survived the war on false papers and retained this name and identification after the war, hiding her Jewish origins from her second husband and daughter. While Helena had obtained a law degree in the 1930s, she chose to work as a clerk rather than admit her Jewish origins, as her former name was on the law degree.
