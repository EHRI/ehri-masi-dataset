Helene Mashan Cohn (1883-1971) was born in Königs-Wusterhausen Germany. She married Eugen Cohn in Berlin in 1910, and their son Gunter was born in Berlin in 1911. Gunter immigrated to Cuba in early 1939. His parents tried to join them aboard the MS St. Louis in May 1939, but the ship was returned to Europe. The Cohns disembarked in France, but continued to pursue immigration to Cuba to rejoin their son. They finally sailed to Cuba via Portugal aboard the SS Nyassa in early 1942. Helene died in Florida in 1971.

Eugen Cohn (1884-1953) was born in Berlin, Germany. He married Helene Mashan Cohn in 1910, and their son Gunter was born in Berlin in 1911. Gunter immigrated to Cuba in early 1939. His parents tried to join them aboard the MS St. Louis in May 1939, but the ship was returned to Europe. The Cohns disembarked in France, and Eugen was interned at St. Cyprien and Gurs. The couple continued to pursue immigration to Cuba to rejoin their son and finally sailed there via Portugal aboard the SS Nyassa in early 1942. Gunter's future sister-in-law, Ruth Froehlich Guttmann, and her husband Salus were also aboard the St. Louis, disembarked in England, and survived the war. Gunter remained in Cuba for 21 years before moving to Florida.

The Eugen and Helene Cohn papers include correspondence and certificates documenting the couple’s health and status as refugees and internees in France following their return to Europe aboard the MS St. Louis, their efforts to gather the necessary documentation to emigrate to Cuba via Portugal, and their departure for Cuba aboard the SS Nyassa.
