Alexander Gleis (1913-1999) and his wife Wanda Gleis (nee Feuer, d. 2010) lived in Stanisławów, Poland (Stanislav/Ivano-Frankivs’k, Ukraine). Gleis survived the Polish front, and he and his wife survived the Stanisławów ghetto, but their newborn daughter was killed during an Aktion in the spring of 1942. Just before the ghetto’s final liquidation, the couple was hidden in an underground shelter by their Polish Catholic rescuer, Stanislaw (Staszek) Jackowski, with 30 other people. Their son, Akeda, was born in August 1944, the month following Stanisławów’s liberation by the Soviet army. They made their way to displaced persons camp in Germany and then to Israel in 1949, where their daughter Ruth was born.

The Alexander Gleis papers consist primarily of Gleis' firsthand accounts of his experiences surviving the Stanisławów ghetto, hiding in an underground shelter at the home of a Polish Catholic named Staszek Jackowski, being liberated, and moving to Israel. The papers also include retellings of the Jackowski story by Ruth Gruber and in clippings, biographical materials documenting Gleis and his wife, maps of Stanisławów, photographs of Gleis and his family before and after the war, and two letters to Gleis from the Bayerisches Landesentschädigungsamt.
