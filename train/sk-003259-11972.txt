Okresný ľudový súd v Sobranciach

2 boxes, paper

Once the Regulation on the retributive justice ceased to be valid on 31 December 1948, documents of District People´s Courts together with the documents of their prosecutors were transferred to respective Regional Courts (Krajský súd), where they were stored for several years. Regional Courts then transferred the documents to state archives. Documents of this particular fonds were transferred to the State archive in Košice in 1965. They were subsequently sorted and processed. The register of the fonds was created in 1971.

Following the Second World War trials with Nazi criminals and their collaborators were organized on the territory of restored Czechoslovakia just like in many other European countries of those days. Three-tier retributive justice system was established in the Slovak part of post-war Czechoslovakia by the Regulation of the Slovak National Council no. 33/1945 on the Punishment of Fascist Criminals, Occupants, Traitors and Collaborators and on the Establishment of People’s Judiciary.
District People’s Courts (Okresný ľudový súd), which were established at district seats with the jurisdiction over the territory of specific districts represented the second tier within the system of the retributive judiciary in Slovakia. Within their jurisdiction fall all criminal offenses stipulated by the Regulation No. 33/1945 with the exception of cases under the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Court (which tried only the leading officials of former Slovak Republic (1939-1945)).
A 5-member Senates of District People´s Courts, consisting of a Senate president and four member decided cases. The Senate president and his deputy had to be professional judges.

The fonds contains several files concerning separate cases of denunciation of Jews hiding in the vicinity of Vyšné Nemecké, Ruskov and Koňuša in 1944.
