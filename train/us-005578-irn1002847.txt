FDR speaks

"Roosevelt Asks U.S. to Crush Hitler" Labor Day, 1941. Hyde Park, NY. FDR to camera: "American labor now bears a tremendous responsibility in the winning of this most brutal, most terrible of all wars. In our factories and shops and arsenals we are building weapons on a scale great in its magnitude. To all the battlefronts of the world, these weapons are being dispatched by the day and by the night, over the sea and thru the air. And this nation is now devising and developing a new weapon of unprecedented power toward the maintenance of democracy." Roosevelt speaking: "I give solemn warning to those people who think that Hitler has been blocked and halted, that they are making a very dangerous assumption. When in any war, your enemy seems to be making slower progress than he did the year before, that is the very moment to strike with redoubled force to throw more energy into the job of defeating him, to end for all time the menace of world conquest and thereby end all talk or thought of any peace founded on a compromise with evil itself." Roosevelt speaking: "The task of defeating Hitler may be long and arduous. There are a few appeasers and nazi sympathizers who say that it cannot be done. They even ask me to negotiate with Hitler to pray for crumbs from his victorious table. They do, in fact, ask me to become the modern Benedict Arnold, to betray all that I hold dear; my devotion to our freedom; to our churches; to our country. This course I have rejected and I reject it again." Paramount News closing titles and fanfare (not quite complete).
