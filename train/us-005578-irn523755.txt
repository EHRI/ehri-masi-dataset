Gad Beck (1923-2012) was born Gerhard Beck in Berlin to Heinrich and Hedwig (Kretchmar) Beck. His father was Jewish, and his mother was Protestant. He was active in the Hechalutz Zionist youth movement and developed his first serious relationship with fellow member Manfred Lewin, who was killed at Auschwitz in 1942. Gad was ordered to report to a temporary internment camp for Jewish spouses of non-Jews in 1943, but he was released with the others following a protest by their non-Jewish relatives. He worked with Chug Halutzi, a clandestine group of Jewish youth members of the Hechalutz movement in Berlin, for the remainder of the war, was arrested in March 1945, and was liberated by the Soviets in April.

The Gad Beck papers consist of a miniature book, two photographs, and an aphorism. The booklet, titled "Erinnerst Du Dich," was created by Manfred Lewin as a souvenir for his lover, Gad Beck, and includes sketches, poetry, and memories. One photograph is a portrait of Manfred Lewin, and the other is a photograph taken by Manfred Lewin of Gad Beck and other members of their youth movement on the roof of the Jewish school at Artilleriestrasse 14 in Berlin. The aphorism is by Wilhelm von Humboldt and describes the beauty of the gift of life.
