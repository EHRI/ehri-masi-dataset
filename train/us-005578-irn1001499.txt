Belsen's women -- as savage as any of the men. Kramer's chief assistant -- 21 years old and a veteran of five years of atrocities -- is Fraulein Irma Grose [sic]....The accused wear identifying numbers in early court sessions. There are 26 men -- 19 women. Number two is Fritz Klein, German doctor at Belsen, author of countless deaths. The average of men and women alike is 1000 deaths apiece. The first batch of Nazi butchers -- and one of the worst -- awaits the verdict of Allied justice." Close view of women defendants including Irma Grese, number 9, pan to numbers 10, 11 and 12..
