I'm An American -- Igor Sikorsky

On August 3, 1940 Igor Sikorsky was interviewed by Dr. Henry B. Hazard of the U.S. Department of Justice about his inventions and their use in defending democracy. Sikorsky admits his flying machines have been used to destroy humanity. The industrial designer blames the misuse on the human "ill will." He urges Americans to think of the airplane as a defender of human progress and unity -- not warfare. Sikorsky believes aviation can only reach its full potential in America, where scientists and inventors freely develop ideas without fear or coercion. He adds, “It takes a naturalized citizen from a less happy country to appreciate what freedom means”. The inventor shares his immigration story with Dr. Hazard. Sikorsky shares his vision for aviation.The program ends with the announcement of the Alien Registration Act of 1940. Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky was born on May 25, 1889 in Kiev to physician parents. It is rumored his mother’s love for the work of Leonardo da Vinci sparked his interest in flying machines and industrial design. The aspiring industrial designer entered Kiev Polytechnic Institute, where he conceived his first helicopter, in 1906. Sikorsky continued to work on fixed wing planes in Europe. In 1913, he became internationally known when he designed and operated the first four-engine plane. The passenger plane was later converted to a bomber during WWI. Sikorsky immigrated to America in 1919 after he learned he may be on a “hit list”. The inventor taught Russian immigrants math and other sciences until he could find work. Within a few years he started the Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corp on a friend's chicken farm in Long Island, New York. From 1924 to 1930, he launched several successful aircrafts, flyboats and the first international aircraft. In 1939, Sikorsky revisited and perfected his concept of the single-rotor helicopter. His invention was able to fly, hover and tackle all aspects of torque and lift. Sikorsky went on to create aircrafts that were used for leisure, life-saving missions and war.
