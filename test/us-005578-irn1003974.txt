Hoover's narration tells of Harry Sawyer [pseudonym for William Sebold], a naturalized German citizen who became a double-agent after he was approached by the Gestapo (in reality the Abwehr) in 1939. The footage shows Duquesne entering Sawyer's office. Spies talk with Sawyer and give him money and the blueprints to the ship SS America. Duquesne, "the most cautious of them all," looks around the room before removing diagrams from his shoe. Sawyer shows documents to a Japanese spy. Hoover gives a brief version of the capture of the German spies (among them John Dasch and Walter Kappe) who arrived on US soil via submarine. Footage of Hitler as Hoover asserts that Hitler was intent on punishing the United States for her crimes against Germany. 01:15:56 Private Snauf cartoon called "Three Brothers".
