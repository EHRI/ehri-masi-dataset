It is thought that Manfred's brother, Ted, gave the donor the diary in 1988.

The author came from Borken, on the German/ Dutch border. He served in the British army as paratrooper during the war. His brother, Ted Kaddar (Theo Gans), was a pupil at Trench Hall, where the donor's aunt, Anna Essinger's Bunce Court School was evacuated during the war.
