The Edmund F. Franz papers consist of records Franz collected while serving as the chief administrator of the U.S. Army's War Crimes Branch in Wiesbaden, Germany. The records include reports and English translations of statements and interrogation interviews with German war criminals, prisoners of war, and other witnesses recorded by U.S. Army investigators in 1945 in preparation for the Nuremberg trials. Some of the English materials are accompanied by German versions. The papers also include official U.S. Army photographs depicting scenes of atrocities at Buchenwald and Nordhausen concentration camps, and at Gardelegen, Penig, and Gotha in Germany.
