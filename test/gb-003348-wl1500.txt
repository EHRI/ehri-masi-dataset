This organisation was founded in October 1961 by Simon Wiesenthal with a staff initially of 2 people. Its aims were to identify and evaluate the vast and growing corpus of material on the subject of the Holocaust; to locate witnesses for war crimes trials; to support the judiciary and police authorities through contact with other documentation centres throughout the world in the prosecution of war criminals; and to observe and collect material on neo-nazi organisations.

This collection consists of the yearly/ biannual activity reports of the Dokumentationszentrum des Bundes Juedischer Verfolgter des Naziregimes.
