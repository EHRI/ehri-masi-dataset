Leo Waldbott (1867-1940) was born on 28 January 1867 in a suburb of Lustadt, Germany to Lazarus and Clara Waldbott (d. 1912, née Neu). He had two siblings: Sigmund (1865-1950) and Flora (later Flora Leva, 1868-1948). Leo married Hermine Rosenberger (1867-1920) and they had three children: Emil (1891-1972), Elizabeth (1893-1917), and George (1898-1982). Leo’s sons Emil and George both immigrated to the United States before World War II. Leo worked as a teacher of Jewish Studies in Speyer, Germany. He also helped establish a Jewish retirement home in Neustadt. During Kristallnacht, the retirement home was burned down. Leo was forced to leave Speyer, and hid in Mannheim until he was able to secure a visa to emigrate from Germany. He immigrated to the United States on 16 December 1938 aboard the SS Europa and settled in Detroit, Michigan.
