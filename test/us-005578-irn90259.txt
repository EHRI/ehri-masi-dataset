Rabbi Rene Hirschler (1905-1945) was a Chief Chaplain for foreign-born Jews in internment camps in the French free zone (1943). Performed relief work in concentration camps, detention and forced labor camps and was active in underground efforts for Jews in hiding. Died in the concentration camp Ebensee a few weeks before the end of the war.

The papers of René Hirschler consist of carbon copies of outgoing correspondence from the office of the chief chaplain. Included are letters to the network of regional chaplains and auxiliary chaplains, individuals interned in internment camps, hospitals, in the Groupements de Travailleurs Etrangers (foreign labor battalions). Also included are letters to individuals involved in the effort to provide assistance to foreign Jews in France during World War II; to Vichy government officials and to Jewish and non Jewish organizations. The collection is fragmentary and covers only the last nine months of Rabbi Hirschler’s administrative records, covering the period March 31, 1943 to December 20, 1943.
