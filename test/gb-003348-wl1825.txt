Lilli Goldwerth was born in Vienna in 1922. Her parents were Abraham Goldwerth (born 1887) and Franziska (1893-1959). In 1939, Lilli's parents were making arrangements for her to emigrate to England. She was to stay with her father's employer, Captain Geoffrey Austin, in St Andrews, Scottland. However, Abraham and Franziska Goldwerth were obliged to leave their daughter behind as her visa did not arrive in time. The couple arrived in Britain in August 1939 with domestic permits. Lilli's visa was later cancelled due to the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1942, her parents were informed via a Red Cross letter that their daughter had died in Vienna. Lilli's parents became British by naturalisation in 1949.
