United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Contains documents, correspondence, and photographs relating to the Blum family from Berlin. Richard Blum, a high fashion tailor, was arrested on Kristallnacht and imprisoned in Sachsenhausen. Includes an example of Richard's business cards; Betty Blum's German passport; various identification documents related to immigration efforts; and photographs taken aboard the MS St. Louis. Richard and Betty left Germany on the MS St. Louis in May 1939 and disembarked in Belgium when the ship returned to Europe. They were briefly imprisoned in the Gurs internment camp in France, and survived the war in hiding in Nice, France. Their two sons, Seev and Hanan, left Germany for Palestine in 1934 and 1936 respectively. The family was reunited in Palestine in 1947.
