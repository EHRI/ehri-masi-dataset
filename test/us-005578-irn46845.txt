Correspondence received by Harry C. Abeles (Heinz Abeles), father of donor, born in Munich, Germany on December 6, 1922. The letters were mostly written by his parents, Margarete Grete Lewy Abeles and Eugen Abeles, in Munich after their son's emigration to the USA in 1937, but the collection also includes correspondence from other family members and friends from Germany, the U.S., England, Canada, and China. Topics include efforts to help his parents and other family members emigrate from Germany, staying in contact with friends and family abroad, including a friend who had immigrated to Shanghai and another who was a prisoner-of-war who had been sent to Canada, and friends and other contacts he met after arriving in San Francisco to live with his uncle, Ernst LÃ¶wy.
