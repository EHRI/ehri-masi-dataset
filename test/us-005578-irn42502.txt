Mikhail (Michael) Lev was born on July 3, 1917 in the town of Pogrebichshe, Kiev Oblast, Ukraine. His family moved to Krivoy Rog (now Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine) where they joined the newly established Jewish agricultural colony in 1926. In 1935, Lev entered a Jewish teacher’s college in Moscow and started working at the Jewish Central Library of the Jewish publishing house, Der Emes (Truth). In 1941, Mikhail Lev joined the Red Army. He was wounded, captured by the Germans, and survived for a year in a prisoner of war camp before escaping. After his escape, he joined the partisans in Belarus where he served as a commander of the intelligence unit and then as a chief of staff of a partisan brigade. After the war, Lev returned to Moscow and continued his work at Der Emes. He also wrote articles for Eynikayt a newspaper published by the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. Following the establishment of the monthly Yiddish journal Sovietishe Geymland (Soviet Motherland), Lev became one of its major contributors and a member of its editorial board. Mikhail Lev published 11 books in Yiddish and Russian, as well as articles and essays. In 1996, Lev immigrated to Israel and died there on May 23, 2013.
