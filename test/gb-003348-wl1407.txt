5 boxes

The provenance of the collection is unknown

The Jewish Relief Unit was the operational arm of the Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad, which was formed in 1943 by the Joint Foreign Committee of the Board of Deputies and the Anglo-Jewish Association and under the auspices and financial responsibility of the Central British Fund for Jewish Relief and Rehabilitation.

This collection consists of the personnel files of former members of the Jewish Relief Unit. This organization, which was based in Great Britain, provided support and assistance of all kinds to Jewish Displaced Persons in the aftermath of the war in Germany. Of particular interest are reports of conditions at individual camps.
