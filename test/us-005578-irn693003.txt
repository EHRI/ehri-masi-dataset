The poster was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

One-sheet, re-release poster for the American feature film, “They Won’t Forget,” originally released in the United States in 1937, and re-released in 1957. Lena Turner only appeared briefly on screen, but when the film was re-released 20 years later, she had become a big enough star that she was given top billing and featured on the marketing materials. “They Won’t Forget” was adapted from the 1936 novel, “Death in the Deep South,” which author Ward Greene based on the 1913 trial of Leo Frank. Frank was a Jewish man wrongly convicted of murdering a 13-year-old girl who worked at the factory he managed. Frank was sentenced to death, but after being commuted to a life sentence by Georgia’s governor in 1915, he was lynched by an angry mob. Rather than directly referencing the only Jewish lynching victim in American history, the creators of “They Won’t Forget” changed the defendant to a professor from the North who works in a small Southern town that is resentful of Northerners and proud of its Confederate history. While both Frank and his fictional counterparts were framed as a result of discrimination, it remains unknown who actually committed the murders. The re-release of the film was set against worsening racial tensions and the Civil Rights movement. In the South, the conflict over integration spawned increased violence towards Jews. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
