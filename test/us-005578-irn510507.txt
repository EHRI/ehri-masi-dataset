Meier Twiasschor (b.1863 in Poland) was married to Lea Goldstein (b.1864 in Kolomyja, Poland) and they had two children, Paul and Diana. Meier and Lea moved from Kolomyja, Poland (currently Ukraine) to Berlin where he was the owner of Columbia Matratzen Stempel & Co and Möbelgeschäft Meier Twiasschorin. Meier and Lea were deported on July 21, 1942 from Berlin to Theresienstadt. Their son Paul had two daughters, Edith and Regina, who both escaped to England to work in households. Their daughter Diana married Israel Goldstein and they had three children Sally (b.1912), Ruth (1914-1997) and Alfred (b.1924) and lived in Berlin. Sally married Siegfried Stempel and had two sons, Oskar (Ozzy, b.1935) and Larry. Siegfried was deported to a labor camp in Belgium, but Sally was able to get him out and they immigrated to the United States. Israel went to New York City where he secured affidavits for his family’s departure, but when he returned to Berlin, he, Diana, and their son Alfred were deported and killed. Ruth was able to use the affidavit because she fell under the German quota and not the Polish quota, as her parents did. Ruth immigrated to the United States.

Isidor Thebner (1875-1944) was born to Michael Thebner, a Rabbi in Vienne, and had six siblings. Isidor was the second oldest son and worked in the shoe business as a representative for Coward Shoes. He and his wife Katarina (Kate, 1879-1933) had two sons, Otto and Arthur (1904-1952), and lived in Vienna. Kate had a brother Ludwig Szinberger, who was deported and died in 1942. Ludwig had a daughter, Ilse (1914-1998) who was able to escape to London. Kate died in 1933. Isidor emigrated from Vienna to the United States in 1939 with his two sons, Otto and Arthur. In 1944 Isidor suffered a heart attack and died. Otto moved to Middleboro, Massachusetts with his wife Lotte where they were also in the shoe business and did not have any children. Arthur moved from Massachusetts to Philadelphia and then to New York where he met and married Ruth Goldstein. They had one daughter, Kathryn (Kitty, 1946), named after Arthur’s mother.
