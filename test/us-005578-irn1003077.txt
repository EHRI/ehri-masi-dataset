War Crimes Trials: film used as evidence in Ministries' Case (#11)

Case XI, Ministries-Keppler, "German Entry into Austria." "The Return to Berlin." Crowds in Berlin await return of Hitler from Austria. Banners fly and flags are thrown to the crowd. Hitler's plane arrives. He gets out, shakes hands with Goebbels. His car rides in state through crowded streets, people saluting and waving flags. A child gives Hitler a flower. He marches by lines of soldiers. One hundred thousand people gather in square. Hitler appears on a balcony with Goering. Police try to hold back hysterical crowds. Amassed close together, the crowd sways singing a song. Hitler appears again. Soldiers marching. The procession goes to Brandenburg Gate, Berlin. Girls rush out to give flowers to returning soldiers. In small border town in Bavaria?, hysterical girls toss wreaths of flowers at passing trucks; a German soldier with child. More marching, saluting children, and decorated army vehicles.
