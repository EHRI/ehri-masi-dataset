Gerd Ramm (1906-1968) a German businessman in Berlin, a producer of paper and blackout blinds, actively resisted the Nazis anti-Semitic practises during the war. He allowed many Jews to work in his factory in Prenzlauer Berg, produced false papers and hid up to 15 Jewish illegal residents. After the war, when faced with financial hardships, he was awarded the highest German award for public service and later nominated one of the Righteous Amongst the Gentiles.

This collection comprises testimonies from former hidden Jews who survived the war thanks to the efforts of Gerd Ramm; also contained is covering correspondence.
