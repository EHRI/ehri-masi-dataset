Robert Brunner was born on October 19, 1906 in Vienna, Austria. During the depression of the 1920s, Brunner traveled to Argentina and worked for a year at a meat packing plant before returning to Europe. On October 18, 1930, he married Alice Albin, who was born on January 6, 1909 in Vienna, Austria. The couple married in France, where Brunner was working as an electrician. After the Anschluss, the couple left Vienna to stay with family in Prague for several months; from there, they went to Marseilles, sailing for South America on November 9, 1938. They arrived first in Chile and made their way to Bolivia. Robert worked doing odd jobs and handyman work for the refugee community in Cochabamba. Their daughter, Judith, was born on October 17, 1940. In the fall of 1944, the couple joined family in the United States. Their son, Peter, was born in the United States.
