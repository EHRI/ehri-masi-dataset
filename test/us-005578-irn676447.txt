Vera Mahler (née Hess, b. 1923) was born in Berga an der Elster to Adolf Hess (1887-1944) and Jette Hess (nee Falk, b. 1896) and had one sister, Ilse (1927-?). Adolf and Jette married in 1922 and lived in Berga where Adolf worked as a manufacturer. Adolf was arrested and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp during Kristallnacht in 1938. He was released four weeks later after promising to leave Germany. Vera and her family left for Cuba aboard the MS St. Louis in 1939. After the ship was denied entry in Cuba and returned to Europe, they disembarked in France. Vera and Ilse were sent to Villa Helvetia, an Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE) children’s home near Montmorency. They stayed in the home for a year before being sent to another OSE home in Montintin for two years, unaware of where their parents were. Adolf was in a series of internment camp, but he was able to obtain visas for Cuba in 1941. Adolf and Jette met Ilse and Vera in Marseille, France before traveling to Spain where they boarded a ship for Cuba. They lived in Cuba for two years before family members in the United States were able to provide affidavits and secure paperwork for immigration to America. Adolf died in 1944, before his family was able to leave Cuba. In mid-1944, Jette, Ilse, and Vera immigrated to the United States. Ilse died prior to 1999 and Vera had two daughters, Joan and Nancy.

The Hess family papers consist of original and photocopies of biographical material, emigration and immigration material, newspapers, and a diary relating to Adolf and Jette Hess and their daughters Ilse and Vera Hess’ voyage on the MS St. Louis, their disembarkation and experiences in France, and their eventual emigration to Cuba in 1941 and the United States in 1944. Biographical material includes documents relating to Adolf’s service in World War I including a certificate for his service, passports for Vera and Jette, paperwork for payment of Adolf’s funeral, and copy of Vera’s birth certificate. The collection includes a photocopy of a diary written by Adolf while aboard the MS St. Louis and in France as well as a translation of the diary. In his diary Adolf writes about his family’s experiences aboard the St. Louis and the struggles of trying to immigrate to Cuba or the United States. Education documents include certificates for Vera during her time in Montintin and Cuba including a certificate for a first aid class, report cards from ORT courses, and a letter of reference from Vera’s work in Cuba as well as newspapers and articles relating to Vera and her education. Emigration and immigration material includes passenger identification cards for Jette and Ilse, a good conduct certificate, a ticket for the St. Louis, Cuban refugee cards, correspondence relating to obtaining visas, safe conduct passes for Adolf, Vera, and Jette, and an affidavit for Jette.
