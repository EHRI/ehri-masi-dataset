The municipality functioned under the Independent State of Croatia since 1941, as par of newly formed Province of Usora and Soli (velika Å¾upa). It was reformed in 1944, after liberation of Tuzla by the Communist Partisans.

The collection includes documents relating to the work of the Office for "renewal", which dealt with the confiscated Jewish and Serbian property within the Independent State of Croatia. Property of Jewish families that were sent to concentration camps was seized by the authorities.
Documents of the collection can serve as a valuable source for studying of the activities and work of the Government of the city of Tuzla in the stated period, but also the history of this region, because the documents can follow the work and procedures related to the property of Jewish families from Tuzla during the war who were taken to camps.
