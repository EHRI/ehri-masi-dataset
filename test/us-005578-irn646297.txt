Max Wertheim (b. 1891) was born on 2 June 1891 in the village of Helmarshausen, Germany to Joseph and Johanne (née Hecht) Wertheim. He had three brothers: Julius, Albert, and Sigmund. He was a merchant and served in the German army during World War I, earning the Iron Cross. Max married Charlotte Herta Nassau (later known as Lotte Wertheim, b. 1905) on 5 March 1929. Lotte was born on 26 December 1905 in Warburg, Germany to Benjamin and Julie (née Steinberg) Nassau. Max and Lotte’s son Klaus-Helmut (later Stanley) was born on 11 November 1930 in Warburg. With the help of Max’s cousin Ted Husing, a well-known sports announcer, whom Max met in Berlin during the 1936 Olympics, the Wertheims were able to secure visas for immigration to the United States. On 19 February 1937 they immigrated to the United States aboard the SS Manhattan. The family settled in New York.
