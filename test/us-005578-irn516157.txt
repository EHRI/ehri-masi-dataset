Herbert Krogman was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on June 13, 1926. He is the only son of Herman Krogman and Frieda Wöhlmuth Krogman. Herman (b. 1896) owned an electrical wholesale business. He met and married Frieda (b. 1898) in Hamburg, Germany in 1924. The Krogman family was active in the Jewish community, and they sent their only son to a Jewish boys’ school.

The Krogman family settled in Malmö where Herman started his own business. Herbert joined the Danish Army in May 1945 over his mother’s objections, and the family returned to Copenhagen. The Krogman electrical business had been taken over by a Danish woman, but all of the customers followed Herman to his new
