1

Consists of one memoir, with copies in the original German and in English translation, written in 1973 by Margarete Borchardt Rund, originally of Berlin, Germany. In the memoir, Mrs. Rund, who was born in 1885, describes her unhappy childhood and difficult marriage to Sigismund Rund, who was the Consul General to Panama and Estonia in the Weimar Republic. During their marriage both her husband (and later she) were unfaithful. She describes the changing life in Berlin after 1933 and her husband's immigration to Switzerland in 1934. She documents the Nazi confiscation of money and her efforts to remain in Berlin, posing as a German refugee from a region destroyed by bombs, using the last name "Runge." The memoir also describes wartime life in Berlin and the destruction caused by the war. After the war, she emigrated to the United States and writes about her post-war life and family.
