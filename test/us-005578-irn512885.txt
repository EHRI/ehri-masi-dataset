Ernst Webenow was born in Berlin, Germany, to Regina Rivka Bader and Artur Abraham Webenow. Ernst immigrated to Palestine in 1936 and was able to bring his parents to Palestine in 1939. He lived in Hertseliyah (Herzlia), Israel, for 52 years before returning to Berlin.

The papers consist of two letters. One letter was written in Belgium on September 8, 1939, by Alfred Bader donor's uncle to his sister, Regina Bader Webenow. This letter was the last communication that the Webenow family received from Alfred Bader before he perished in the Holocaust. The other letter was written on November 24, 1960, by Lully Bader [donor's uncle] and discusses Holocaust restitution issues.
