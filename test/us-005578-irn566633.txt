The first settling person in Ragusa was Jewish merchant from Durazzo, Albania in 1968. In 1492, Ragusa (Dubrovnik) became important transit center for Sephardic exiles from Spain. In 1546 a Jewish ghetto was created and their inhabitants were subject of special taxes. In 1755 a special law was introduced to do not allow the ghetto residences to move outside of the ghetto walls. This restriction was lifted by Napoleon in 1815. The Jews of Dubrovnik were emancipated in 1873.After the World War I Dubrovnik became a part of Yugoslavia. At 1939 in Dubrovnik live 250 Jews.
