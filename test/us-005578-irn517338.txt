Hank Federman is the son of Abraham Morris Federman. Abraham (b. 1910) was the son of Harry Federman, a wealthy Warsaw businessman, and his wife Ruth. Abraham had five siblings: Izhak (b. 1907), Shlomo (b. 1912), Esther (b. 1914), Yankel (b. 1916) and Helen (Hela). Izhak was married to the daughter of a department store mogul, and had a son named Yosele. Abraham immigrated to the United States in 1930 to avoid the Polish draft after Ruth bribed a judge. Harry frequently traveled to the United States on business hoping to eventually relocate the entire family. Unfortunately, he passed away in America on June 3, 1938, and when World War II broke out the following year, the rest of the family was still in Poland. All of the family who remained in Poland perished during the Holocaust.

Consists of one photograph of Jews in Warsaw protesting against Hitlerism, Fascism, and attacks on Jewish schools. In the photograph, taken in 1937, the protesters are carrying signs in Yiddish which read "Down with Fascism; Down with Hitlerism" and "We denounce attacks on Jewish schools." Yankel Federman is pictured second from the left. Also includes a Polish passport, issued in 1930, and a ticket on the SS France, both of which were used by Abraham Federman during his emigration to the United States, as well as a copyprint of a portrait of Federman prior to his departure from Warsaw.
