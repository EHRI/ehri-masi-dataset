Invasion of France

Night scenes: sounds of mortar fire and burning buildings along the Maginot Line. Shots of German planes overhead, aerial views of the Maginot Line, German planes dropping bombs. Germans shooting cannons; soldiers crossing the Rhein in a small boat. More fighting, until the narrator states that Strasbourg, the old German city, is again in German hands. Organ music plays over a shot of a cathedral. German troops pass French civilians on a road. The narrator announces the entry into Metz. Civilians lining the road salute the passing German troops. Happy population of Metz out on the streets; German soldiers holding children.
