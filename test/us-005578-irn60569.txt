Ida Flint Dancyger was born on February 2, 1945, in Chui, Kazakhstan, to Mendel Flint (born October 2, 1911) and Malka Finkelstein Flint (born May 15, 1909). Her parents, both from Warsaw, fled east after the Nazi invasion. They remained in Bialystok until 1941, then fled further east to Kazakhstan. Malka's brother went with them when they fled to Bialystok, but soon returned to Warsaw. Mendel and Malka were the sole survivors of their families. After the war ended, Mendel, Malka, and Ida slowly moved west, finally reaching Austria in 1947, where they lived at the Hallein displaced persons camp until July 1949, when the family immigrated to Toronto, Canada.

Consists of a large portrait, taken in the 1920s, of a young man (possibly her brother) and older woman who were family members of Malka Finkelstein, originally of Warsaw, Poland. Also includes a post-war photograph of Ida Flint, the daughter of Malka Finkelstein and Mendel Flint, with her father at the Hallerin displaced persons camp in post-war Austria.
