Ruth Einstein Marx, Stephen's mother, emigrated from Essen, Germany, in 1939. Julius Einstein, Ruth's maternal grandfather, perished in Theresienstadt concentration camp. Selma Hirsch Einstein, Ruth's maternal grandmother, emigrated via Casablanca, Morocco, to New York in 1941.

Consists of correspondence (letters and telegrams) received by Julius and Selma Einstein between 1939-1941 and 1946-1947. Julius and Selma's daughter Ruth emigrated to the United States in 1939; though the collection contains correspondence sent to Selma Einstein while she was interned in Camp de Gurs in France, Selma was able to immigrate to the United States through Casablanca, Morocco, in 1941 and was briefly interned in Camp Ouedzum in Morocco. Julius Einstein, unable to emigrate, perished after being deported to Theresienstadt (Terezin). Includes correspondence between the Einsteins and the family of Siegmund Hirsch.
