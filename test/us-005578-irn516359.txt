Shlomo Shafir (1924-2013) was born Selimar Frenkel in Berlin, Germany in 1924. During his childhood, his mother, Esther Frenkel (nee Berkmann), was seriously ill with encephalitis. He was educated by his father and grandmother in Eitkoven, a small town in the Lithuanian on the east Prussian border. In 1938 he moved with his father to Kovno, Lithuania (now Kaunas, Lithuania). They eventually moved into the Kovno ghetto where Shlomo began editing and working on the underground newspaper, Nitzotz. He was deported to Dachua concentration through Stutthof in July 1944. He was sent to Kaufering II, where he continued to publish Nitzotz. In November 1944, he was sent to Kaufering I, where he was reunited with his father. There, he continued to publish Nitzotz and participated in other underground activities. On April 29, 1945, Sharif and his father were liberated from Dachua concentration camp. Three weeks after liberation Hermann Frenkel died and was buried in the Woodland Cemetery in Dachau concentration camp. In May 1947, Frenkel married Mina Kaminski, who had been a member of “Irgun Brit Zion” (IBZ). They immigrated to Israel in April 1948. From 1964-1968, Shlomo Shafir served as a US correspondent for the newspaper Davar. From 1974-2005 Shafir served as an editor-in-chief of the journal of the World Jewish Congress, Gesher. He also worked as a research associate of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Israel. Shlomo Shafir died in 2013.
