Consists of one memoir, 11 pages, entitled "Memoirs of my childhood from the Holocaust", by Moshe Brem, origially of Piotrkow Trybunalski, Poland. In 1939, Moshe's father was conscripted into the Polish Army. Moshe, his mother, and his extended family remained in Piotrkow, which became a ghetto, and managed to escape deportation by offering tailoring services to the Germans and by bribing both the Germans and non-Jews in Piotrkow to help the family. In the fall of 1944, however, Moshe and his mother were deported to Ravensbr√ºck. Only a small child, Moshe spent his days hiding while his mother worked. In the early spring of 1945, they were deported to Bergen-Belsen, where they were liberated by the British. They lived for two years in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp before immigrating to Israel in 1947 and reuniting with Moshe's father, who spent the war fighting the Germans in the Middle East.
