Liberation of Ozarichi and Minsk

Wounded people, mostly children, are taken off a train that was intercepted on its way to Ozarichi, a concentration camp in Belarus. They are placed on a cart by Soviet soldiers. Soviet investigators inspect corpses lying in the snow. They perform an outdoor autopsy of sorts on a dead child. Shots of survivors at the camp. Liberated people struggle down the road. Interior scenes of the sick being treated in a hospital. Barbed wire around camp (still Ozarichi?). Scenes of German-occupied Minsk. Germans regulate traffic and check papers of civilians in cars. German soldiers break into a house and search the interior (probably two separate locations edited together). Germans walk down a street with destroyed buildings. Barbed wire around the Minsk ghetto, followed by the same shot of the German soldiers walking down the street. Pan up to a sign on the ghetto fence in German and Russian which reads, "Those who climb over the fence will be shot." Scenes from Maly Trostinets concentration camp, including a sign which reads, "Access to the camp is forbidden! [Trespassers] will be shot without warning." A shot of a pile of corpses is followed by a shot of corpses being burned in a huge pile.
