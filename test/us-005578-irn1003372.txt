Finland

Map showing Norway, Sweden, and Finland. German soldiers loading munitions, animals, vehicles and supplies onto a ship bound for the Finnish front. Views of the soldiers boarding the ship: they are shot from below as they climb steep steps up to the deck of the ship. Life of the troops on board the ship as it speeds toward Finland, including cleaning boots, shaving, eating, playing cards. The Soviet Union attacked Finland in November 1939, launching the so-called Winter War, which lasted until March 1940. The Finns managed to inflict quite a bit of damage on the Soviets, but they nonetheless lost territory and resources with the signing of the Moscow Treaty. Finland accepted Nazi Germany's support in the time leading up to and during the Continuation War, which Finland fought against the Soviet Union beginning in June 1941.
