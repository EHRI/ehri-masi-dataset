A substantial part of the papers concerning the period 1911 to 1945 have been lost during the Second World War. The damage was especially acute for the years 1929 to 1945. The remaining parts were acquired by the Hungarian National Archive in 1948. Many of the reference works have also been lost, those that have been found entered the fond of the Archive in 1951.

A whole row of Hungarian Prime Ministers and their offices have played notable roles in the history of anti-Semitism and the persecution of the Jews during the 1930s and 1940s. In Hungary, anti-Semitic initiatives, including anti-Semitic legislation, was often launched and even more often supported at this level. In 1944, following the entry of Nazi Germany into Hungary, it was the newly appointed government headed by Prime Minister Döme Sztójay that actively collaborated with the German Sonderkommando in the implementation of the mass deportations to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Records of the Prime Minister’s Office held at the Hungarian National Archive are therefore of paramount important for the study of the Holocaust in Hungary. These records are unfortunately far from complete. However, they do contain a fragment of the Presidential, Press and Social Policy Departments for the years 1923 to 1945 as well as confidential papers issued under "res." or "biz." from 1915 onward. The former papers (called "res.") were issued by the Presidential Department, the latter (called "biz.") at the Minority Department.
