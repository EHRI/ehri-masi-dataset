Paul Bojko (born Pawlo Bojko) was born on 31 July 1937 in Stawok (Kremenchuk), Ukraine to Gregorie (1903-1947?) and Charytina (1909-1964). He has one brother, Victor. His family was Orthodox, and owned a small farm. In 1943, even though the family was not Jewish, the Nazis looted and destroyed the farm, and deported the family and Paul’s grandparents to several concentration camps, including the Auschwitz concentration camp. After approximately 5-6 months in Auschwitz, they were deported to Nuremberg and sent to a forced-labor camp. Gregorie was also subjected to medical experiments. After liberation, the family was sent to a displaced persons camp in Weissenburg, Germany. Gregorie’s health had worsened due to the medical experiments, and he died around 1947-1948. Charytina suffered a stroke and became paralyzed. Paul and his brother Victor were sent to a children’s home at Prien am Chiemsee in 1948. They were then transferred to the Bad Aibling Children’s Village in November 1948. The children remained there until its closing in 1951. They were able to immigrate to the United States in 1951 with the help of the International Refugee Organization. They were sent to several foster homes and farms in Maryland. Paul later joined the United States Army, and after his discharge he married and worked for Black and Decker.
