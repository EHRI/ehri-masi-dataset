An employee of Lizzi Grünwald's nursing home&nbsp;kept these papers and donated them to the Wiener Holocaust Library in 2018.

<p>Lizzi Grünwald was born on 7 August 1917 in Vienna to Jewish parents, Leopold Grünwald and Jakoline Grünwald née Hirsch. In Austria she worked as seamstress’s assistant and nanny. She came to Britain in May 1939 as a domestic servant. In May 1940, she was interned as an enemy alien in Rushen Camp. After her release, her cousin Grete Meyer, who was also in Britain, sought to help Lizzi find another domestic position. In November 1941, she was working as a factory hand and in April 1943 as a needleworker. </p><p>By 1999 Lizzi was living in St. John’s Nursing Home, Boston, where she died on 12 December 2003.&nbsp;She does not seem to have married or had any next of kin.&nbsp;</p>
