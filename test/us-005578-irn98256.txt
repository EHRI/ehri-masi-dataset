Fundacja Polsko-Niemieckie Pojednanie

Foundation Polsko-Niemieckie Pojednanie (FPNP) was established on November 27, 1991 per initiative of the government of the Republic of Poland. The Foundation collected approximately one million applications submitted by individuals, who sought compensation for their forced labor for Third Reich during the German occupation of Poland. These applications usually quote detailed information about condition of work and indicate geographical locations, and also are supported by testimonies of witnesses, original photographs and documents.

This collection contains copies of 20,534 personal files of those assisted by the Fundacja Polsko-Niemieckie Pojednanie (FPNP). These files often contain beneficiary’s application (with individual call number) which details the places and conditions of work (forced labor); statements; accounts or testimonies; letters from the period of occupation and/or other documents (most often copies) in support of a claim; doctor’s certificates; notarized copies of archival documents; photographs; certificates from various institutions; and correspondence with the Foundation.
