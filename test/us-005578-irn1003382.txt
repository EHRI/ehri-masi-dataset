The "Altmark" was a cargo vessel that took refuge in the Jossing Fjord (near Bergen, Norway) after being pursued by British and Norwegian ships. The Altmark was carrying some 300 British seamen who had originally been taken prisoner by the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in the South Atlantic. On the 16th of February, 1940, the British destroyer HMS Cossack entered the Fjord and captured the Altmark, gaining the release of the British prisoners and killing several German seamen. The Altmark was undamaged and allowed to return to Germany. The titles repeat, one after the other. They are centered and do not run off the screen. 01:03:18
