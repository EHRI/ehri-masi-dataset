I'm An American -- Fortune Gallo

On August 3, 1941 Fortune Gallo spoke with Fred J. Schlotfeldt, District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service of Chicago, about how his faith in democracy brought him success. Gallo reveals he wanted to come to America and make a fortune like his Uncle. He explains the lack of opportunities in Europe and why. The impresario shares how he immigrated to America in the bottom of a boat. He also tells Mr. Schlotfeldt how he got his start in opera and announces his new appointment to the General Manager of the Chicago Opera Company. Gallo explains how opera is improving American lives. He suggests a ‘Temple of Music’ where music from those who have made America their home can be honored. The segment concludes with the opera director disclosing what he believes are the most precious benefits of American citizenship. Fortune Gallo was born on May 9, 1878 in Torremaggiore, Italy. As a child he became involved with music and musicians. He immigrated to the United States at 17 with only 14 cents in his pocket. Three years later, the 20-year-old became the advance man for a famous Italian concert band called ‘Banda Rossa.’ Gallo began his career as an opera impresario in 1912, when he established the San Carlo Opera Company in New York City. He also served as the managing director of the Chicago Opera, and as the manager and tour director of the Original Ballet Russe. Gallo continued to manage all publicity, work and business for the San Carlo Opera Company until he disbanded it in 1955. The impresario is credited with having done more than any other man to popularize grand opera in America.
