Children

Very short clip from the film "Helfende Haende" Little kids in courtyard. CU, delightful faces of children, all very serious (2-5 year olds). Shots of family moving into a home. Narration: "Homes of fleeing/escaping [gefluchteter] Poles and wandering Jews become possession of the Germans." Woman sweeps kitchen floor/ breaks off here.
