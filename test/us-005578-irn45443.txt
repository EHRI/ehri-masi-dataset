Documents and correspondence illustrating the efforts of Leon Marokus, who immigrated to the United States in 1938 from Poland and worked to bring over his wife Lajcia and daughters Henryka and Pola, who were in Lwow, Poland and unable to leave. Includes pre-war correspondence between Leon and various organizations including the US Department of State as well as post-war correspondence concerning his youngest daughter Pola, who was hidden in Lwow and potentially survived. The correspondence documents Leon's exhaustive but unsuccessful efforts to find Pola or her rescuer Anna Chodek over more than five years and working with multiple agencies, relief organizations and individuals who tried to assist. Includes a leaflet picked up by donor's father while in the military during WWII.
