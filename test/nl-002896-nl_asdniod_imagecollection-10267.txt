Freedom of worship returns to Metz. American soldiers enter the Synagogue in Metz in eastern france to attend special Channucka services of rededication, in the first religious ceremony held in the synagogue since it had been closed by the Nazi invaders. During enemy occupation, the building was used as a warehouse with religious scrolls removed and the altar defiled. When the Third U.S. Army wrested the bastion city from the enemy November 22, 1944, places of worship were reopned and civilians flocked to the cathedral and the synagogue to give thanks for their liberation.
