Le P. Tacchi Venturi au cardinal Maglione

Unavailable.

Tacchi Venturi writes cardinal Maglione that he was informed by the director-general Demography and Race that the new racial law is inconsistent about baptised children from mixed marriages. The director-general is preparing an amendment which will state that all baptised children from mixed marriages will be considered Aryans regardless of the date of the baptism, and asks for the support of the Holy See.
