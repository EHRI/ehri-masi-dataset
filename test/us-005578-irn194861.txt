Izak “Izy” Rosenblat (1912-1993) was born in Warsaw, Poland to Josek and Chana Rosenblat. At the age of 9, his family moved to Radom, and at age 11, Izy left school to train as a tailoring apprentice. After apprenticing with several tailors, Izy returned to school and earned a tailor’s license. In 1938, Izy married Taube Fishman, who was the daughter of Izy’s first employer. They continued to live in Radom, where Izy opened his own tailoring shop. In July of 1939, their son Max was born. Soon after, Germany invaded Poland and Radom was occupied by the Nazis. Izy’s house and shop was taken from him, and his family was forced to live in a shack in the ghetto. As a tailor by trade, Izy was forced into service for the Nazis, working in an SS shop. In 1942, the Germans began a roundup of Jews in the city, and both Taube and Max were taken to Treblinka, where they were eventually killed. Izy, meanwhile, continued to work in forced labor. In 1944, Izy was part of a roundup that resulted in being sent to Auschwitz, before being sent to Stuttgart-Vaihingen, Germany, where he remained until liberation. After being liberated, Izy obtained a visa to the United States through the family of friends, and immigrated to New York in 1950.
