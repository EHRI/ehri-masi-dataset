German invasion of Denmark

German planes overhead as Germany invades Denmark. The narration says that in order to protect the neutrality of the Scandinavian countries German troops have been dispatched to Denmark and Norway. LS of a park in Copenhagen with hundreds of leaflets scattered on the ground. CU of a hand holding one of the leaflets. A German general and a Danish officer salute each other. Exterior view of the German embassy. Ambassador Renthe-Fink and General Nimmer smile while standing next to the embassy. Danish soldiers receive pistols and cigarettes from German soldiers. Civilians wave to German troops passing in the street. A Danish soldier holds a child while conversing with a German soldier. A German soldier directs traffic. LS of the bustling city of Copenhagen while the voiceover says that normality had returned by midday.
