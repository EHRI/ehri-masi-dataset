Crimea

Map of the Crimea. German soldiers in the devastated city of Jevpatorija, where houses and other buildings have been destroyed. Fires still burn in the background as the Germans reconnoiter. Explosions and sniper fire. Germans fire a howitzer and toss grenades. They climb onto the tiled roof of one of the houses. A group of Soviets surrender. German soldiers toss a grenade into the basement of a structure; an injured man tries to crawl out of the building a moment later. More capture of Soviets. Pan across a group of them standing next to a wall, their arms raised.
