Rudy and Hilde Miller collection

boxes

2

Correspondence and documents of Hilde and Rudy Miller and their lawyer Hans Strauss concerning reparations for materials and business dispossessed of them for being Jewish. Correspondence discusses, in particular, Rudy’s loss of business after the Nazis instigated a boycott on Jewish businesses and forced the Millers, who did not know each other, to flee. Both Rudy (born Windmueller) and Hilde (born Mueller) had to flee and leave behind their immediate families who did not survive. Included in collection is a photograph attached to an identity card fragment for Emma Windmueller, Rudy’s mother. Also includes affidavits and correspondence illustrating efforts to assist Else Kraemer [Rudy’s second wife] who lived in Berlin and depended on family in Indiana to assist her in emigrating from Germany.
