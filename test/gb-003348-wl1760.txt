Prior to September 1939 the farm used to be a Jewish agricultural training school. With the arrival of the refugees, nursery, health, laundry and kitchen training was added to the agricultural training for girls. New accommodation and workshops had to be built as there were about 80 refugees on the farm at the beginning of the Second World War. </div><br><div>Gerald spent eight years on the farm.
