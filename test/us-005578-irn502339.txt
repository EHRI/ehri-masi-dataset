Fritz Weinschenk (1920-2012) was born in Mainz, Germany but left in 1935 because of Nazi persecution. He volunteered for the U.S. Army immediately after Pearl Harbor and became a naturalized citizen while undergoing his military training. His unit landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day and later served in the Pacific. After the war he returned to Germany to serve in the U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps and worked with the U.S. prosecution team in the trial of German war criminals at Nuremberg. In New York he became one of the “attorneys of confidence” to the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany, and from the 1960s to the 1990s he was frequently appointed commissioner by West German courts and prosecutors in proceedings against war criminals. He published articles about the German trials and served as counsel for Nazi victims in hundreds of restitution and indemnification claims.

The Fritz Weinschenk papers primarily consist of case files documenting his assistance obtaining witness testimony related to war crimes proceedings in Germany. The papers also include Weinschenk’s writing files related to articles he wrote about the war crimes trials, and Gestapo Bremen and Abwehr files, which contain guidelines and regulations related to the Gestapo and government security.
