Consists of one typed memoir, in English, written by Emily Kessler in 1993. In 1941, her husband was killed near Strye in Drohobycz, and Emily, her mother and infant son were evacuated to Khmelnik. She describes forced labor in Khmelnik, moving into the ghetto, and escaping a mass shooting with the assistance of local fascists. She and her son were imprisoned and sent back into the ghetto for forced labor. She went into hiding with the help of a non-Jewish friend, Katya Surovova (who was later named a Righteous Among the Nations) and crossed the border into Romania. She and her son survived the war and emigrated to the United States.
