Franz Zürni (born 1912) was a chauffeur. Zürni worked as a driver for 40 years for the moving firm Welti-Furrer. From 1939 to 1945 he served in the Swiss compulsory military service (“Aktivdienst”). In the aftermath of World War II, Zürni delivered care shipments by truck on behalf of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to the Prisoner of War (POW) and former concentration camps. Zürni was part of the first relief convoy under Swiss leadership in May 1945 with ca. ten truck drivers who drove via St. Margrethen towards Germany. The convoy arrived in Mauthausen on May 23, 1945 and, after delivering the relief shipment, continued on to Linz. During the nine months of driving for the ICRC, Zürni transported liberated concentration camp prisoners and drove shipments to the former Theresienstadt camp as well as prison camps in Bavaria, Flotow an der Weeser, Bad Oehnhausen and several other prison camps in the British zone. Afterwards, Zürni continued his employment with Welti-Furrer. During the Hungarian crisis in 1956 Zürni again served as driver for the Swiss Red Cross.

Consists of primary source archival records, photographs, and a recorded television interview pertaining to Franz Zürni’s mission (1945/1946) to transport relief shipments on behalf of the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC), as well as Zürni’s personal papers and interviews. Includes photographs taken by Zürni of the Mauthausen and Buchenwald concentration camps shortly after liberation and a television interview (VLC media file) with Franz Zürni broadcast by TeleZüri on 21 July 1998. The television broadcast also features a segment on the conviction for Holocaust denial of publisher Gerhard Förster and his client, Swiss Holocaust revisionist and author Jürgen Graf by a Swiss court.
