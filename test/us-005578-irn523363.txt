Arthur survived the war in hiding, but his first wife, Sala, and their son, Jurek, perished. Mala and her husband, Józef, were deported to a death camp and perished. Menachem Nunbergier together with his wife, Nacha, and two children perished as well. Mosze fought the Germans as a member of a partisan group and was killed in action.
