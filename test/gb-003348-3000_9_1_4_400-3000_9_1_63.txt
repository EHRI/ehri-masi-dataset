Correspondence with American Jewish Committee (AJC)

53 letters

Founded in 1906 the American Jewish Committee (AJC) is one of the oldest and largest Jewish advocacy organizations. Its mission is to enhance the well-being of Jewish people and Israel, and to advance human rights and democratic values in the United States and worldwide. See Bogin, F. D. (ed.), , London, Garland, 1993.

The correspondence deals primarily with publications related to National Socialism or post war Antisemitism, the latter mainly with focus on Italy, West Germany and Austria. Furthermore, the letters regard information requests on a German allegedly involved in medical crimes in concentration camps, and on activities of Ukrainian nationalist Stepan Bandera and his group.

Contained are an invoice and a cheque for the Jewish Central Information Office (1940), a memo on political education of the German youth (1956), an outline of The Wiener Library’s political tasks to substantiate the renewal of the Committee’s grant for the Library (1958), and a press cutting (1960).
