Carl Zucker (1925-2006) was born Kasriel Zuckermann (Cukierman) on 13 April 1925 in Zakroczym, Poland to Zelig and Doba Cukierman. His father Zelig (1891-1941) was a cobbler. His mother Doba (née Chonolewicz, 1891-1943) was born in Olkusz, Poland and operated the family’s paint store in their house. Carl had one brother, Srulek (1921-1943). After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 the family was in the Zakroczym ghetto. They were moved to the Nowy Dwór ghetto in December 1940. Carl was a forced-laborer in a brick factory in Kosevo from spring to fall 1940. In fall 1940 he was on a highway construction project in Novogrudok, Poland. From August 1941 to November 1942 he repaired shoes and loaded barbed wire onto trains in Nowy Dwór. Around December 1942 he was deported to Auschwitz III (Buna) where he was tattooed with the number 83049. He was a forced-laborer for an IG Farben factory. He was sent to Ohrdruf subcamp of Buchenwald in October 1944. In April 1945 he was sent to Theresienstadt where he was liberated a month later. Carl’s father died in Zakroczym in 1941 and his mother and brother both perished at Auschwitz in 1943. After liberation Carl went to the Foehrenwad displaced persons camp. He reconnected with Edith Guzy, whom he likely met while in Auschwitz. They married in 1945 and their daughter Masia (Marcia) was born in 1946. In 1949 the family immigrated to the United States aboard the USS General. R.M. Blatchford. They settled in Newark, New Jersey and their son Saul was born in 1950.

Edith Zucker (1917-2003, some records place birthdate as 17 May 1921) was born Edith Guzy on 11 December 1917 in Olkusz, Poland to Zalma and Masia Guzy. Her father Zalma (1890-1943) was born on 17 July 1890 in Olkusz and made leather uppers for shoes. Her mother Masia (née Szpilman, 1885-1943) was born on 30 November 1885 and was a housewife. Edith had three siblings: Esther (Chaya, 1915-1943?), Lajzer Guzy (1923-1943), and Brajndla (1925-1943). After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Edith and her family were forced into the Olkusz ghetto. In April 1942 Edith, her brother Lajzor, and sister Brajndla were sent to the Będzin ghetto. In Będzin she sewed uniforms in one of the workshops run by Alfred Rossner. In August 1943 the ghetto was liquidated and there was also an uprising organized by the Jewish Combat Organization. Edith hid from the Germans during this time, but when she left her hiding spot the next day she discovered her brother and sister dead in the street. She was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau on 3 August 1943. She was tattooed with the number 52912. Edith was a forced-laborer working in fields and on road construction. She also worked in the kitchen. In early January 1945 she was sent on a death march to Ravensbrück. In March 1945 she was transferred to the Neustadt-Glewe subcamp and was liberated on 2 May 1945. Edith’s parents and sister Esther remained in Olkusz after she was sent to Będzin. They were likely deported to Auschwitz in 1943 where they perished. After liberation, Edith returned to Olkusz briefly and then went to the Foehrenwald displaced persons camp. While in the DP camp she reconnected with Carl Zucker, whom she likely had previously met while in Auschwitz. They married in 1945 and their daughter Masia (Marcia) was born in 1946. In 1949 the family immigrated to the United States aboard the USS General. R.M. Blatchford. They settled in Newark, New Jersey and their son Saul was born in 1950.
