United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Contains an illustrated photo album created by seventeen-year-old Max Appelbaum. The album uses a grouping of donated family photographs from the Marie Louise Refugee Center in St. Simon, near Toulouse, France to show their appreciation to camp director Jacob Huisman and his wife Judith who lived in the camp with children Michele and Annie (donor's uncle and mother). The photo album is dated 1942 and was presented to the family before they immigrated to Toronto, Canada. Includes a group of loose photographs showing pre-war families' experiences. The Marie Louise Refugee Center, a Belgium and Dutch refugee center, was unique to southern France, which at the time was under the Vichy Government.
