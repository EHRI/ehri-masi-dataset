[Letter by SIG to Biggar]

1 electronic ressource (1 page)

This file contains a letter written in the name of the SIG (Swiss Israelite Alliance) to the AIU (French israelite Alliance), written in 1933 and addressed to Mr. Biggar, probably the president of the organisation. The SIG informs the AIU about the situation in Switzerland, specifically in regards to rising antisemitism connected to the propagation of the Protocols of the elder of Zion. To stop the rapid diffusion and to reveal the falsification of the Protocols, the SIG plans on involving the law. Thus the Bern trials will soon start. At the end of the letter they ask the AIU for support in this cause.
