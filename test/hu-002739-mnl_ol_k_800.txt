Nyilas igazságügy-minisztérium (Szombathely)

1 box, 1 fasc., 1 booklet, 0,3 linear metres

Due to the advancement of the Red Army in the battle for Hungary and its approaching of Budapest, the Arrow Cross Ministry of Justice was moved to Szombathely in Western Hungary in the second half of November 1944 and had its seat at the main Courthouse of the town. The Ministry was in operation in Szombathely until the end of March but could rely only on a reduced number of its staff there. The papers of the relocated Hungarian Ministry of Justice from 1944 were presumably destroyed. The remaining papers that are to be found in this collection at the Hungarian National Archive are from the first months of 1945 and are of a more general nature. They include complaints and requests sent to the Ministry of Justice, criminal cases, cases that concerned international law, matters of supervising courts, lawyers and notaries, the issue of press censorship, etc.
