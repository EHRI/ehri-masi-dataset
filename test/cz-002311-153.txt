The documents of the district office were inappropriately stored in various cellars and attics of Zlín buildings such as the town hall, the chateau, and the Study Institute, and in the post-war years also in Uherské Hradiště, Štípa and Bojkovice. Improper storage has damaged and destroyed many materials. The fonds was inventoried in 1975. In 2012, it was administratively divided according to chronological criteria into separate fonds of the Zlín District Office I and the Zlín District National Committee.

The District Office in Zlín was established in 1935. A district governor was appointed head, who chaired the advisory boards - the district council and its adjacent body - the district committee. During the Nazi occupation (1939–1945), Zlín was the seat of the Oberlandrat (1939–1942), and the district office was subject to its control. In 1942, the so-called Reichsauftragsverwaltung were established. They took over an important part of the security-administrative agenda from the district authorities.

The fonds contains documents of public administration, official books, files, accounting material and associated agenda.
