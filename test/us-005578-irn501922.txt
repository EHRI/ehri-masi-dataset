Max Maier (1891‐1976) was a lawyer born in Frankfurt to businessman Hermann Heinrich Maier and Cäcilie Minna Scheyer. During World War I he served as a lieutenant in the German army, and in 1920 he married Mathilde (Titti) Wormser (1896‐1997), who was born in Dinslaken to Leopold Wormser and Bertha Kahn. Mathilde had earned a PhD in Chemistry. Max’s brother Hans Maier (1889‐1937) was a lawyer and prominent figure in social reform and welfare in Weimar Germany. He married Anna Margarete Grätz in 1914, and the couple had three children: Hanna (1915‐2003), Heinrich (Henry, 1918‐2005), and Margarete (1921‐1997). When Hans Maier committed suicide a few months after his wife’s death in 1937, Max Maier became their children’s legal guardian. In November 1938, Max and Mathilde Maier emigrated with Margarete Maier to Rolândia, Brazil where they had purchased some land in 1936, became farmers, and obtained Brazilian citizenship in 1951 and 1953.
