Hepner and Cahn: family papers

2 folders

This collection of papers consists primarily of original (and some copy) correspondence between friends and relatives of the Cahn Hepner family. KÃ¤the Ruth Cahn-Hepner (1924-2019) and Mrs Jacobs-Hepner, the depositors of this collection, are the daughters of Fritz and Leonie Cahn, German Jews who spent the war years in Switzerland. The depositors provided brief notes about most of the correspondents, many of whom perished in the Holocaust. This information has been incorporated into the descriptions below, along with information from additional sources, which sheds further light on their fate. In addition, there are miscellaneous writings and some newspaper cuttings [1206/2/1-2]. Many of the letters have been annotated (probably by the depositors) with information relating to the correspondents' identity and/ or fate.
