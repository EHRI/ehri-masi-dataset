Nazi Party Rally

Title on screen: "Parteitag der Freiheit." Reich Party Day in Nuremberg, 9/10-9/16, 1935. Music plays over a view of a hall filled with Party members standing at attention in front of a large Swastika flag backdrop. The front row is composed of high-ranking leaders, including Hitler, Hess, Streicher, others. The camera pans slowly to an empty podium, then back to the Party leaders. Hess approaches the podium, salutes, and announces the opening of the seventh Reich Party congress. Low aerial shots of the huge crowd, and shots of other leaders, including Goering, Frank, Rosenberg, Goebbels (later), as well as a couple of men in civilian dress. Focus on Nazi flag standards that bear the names of fallen Nazis. Brief close-up of Hitler as Hess mentions his name.
