This collection consists of two items: an original illustrated account of life as an internee of an internment camp on Douglas, isle of Man, 1940-1941 and an undated typescript family history by another family member. The first item comprises a series of individual sketches of camp life mostly in verse form, which have subsequently been bound together and foliated.
