Radio L'Chayim broadcast: Brundibar

"Radio Lâ€™Chayim" program broadcast on May 15, 1988 over KCSN-FM, Northridge CA, featuring Cantor Michael Russ (host) and Los Angeles-based musician, Judith Berman. The recording is significant because it preserves the first US English-language performance of the children's opera (originally in Czech) "Brundibar." The performance took place April 20, 1982 at Temple Beth Hillel, North Hollywood CA, with Berman directing from the piano. Berman prepared the score and translation; she was later enjoined from publishing or further staging her version by the copyright holder, Joza Karas, who had created his own performing edition and English translation.
