Leaflet against Hitler: 'Gebt mir vier Jahre Zeit'

1 folder

The leaflet confronts images of Hitler and quotations made by Hitler from 1939 to 1943 with pictures of the destroyed cities of Rotterdam and Hamburg as well as images of the Wehrmacht in Poland and the Soviet Union. A handwritten comment on the third page indicates that the leaflet was dropped by the R.A.F in 1943 or 1944.
