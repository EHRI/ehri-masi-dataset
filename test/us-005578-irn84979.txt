Their son Boris (later Boris Altshtater) was born on 25 May 1938. Before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, they owned an orthopedic prosthetic shop in Zagreb. In 1941, Alfred faced persecution by the Ustaše and was subsequently deported to the Stara Gradiška subcamp of the Jasenovac concentration camp where he perished in 1943. After he was deported, Elvira, Boris, and members of the Pisker and Fischer families fled to Crikvenica, Croatia. In 1942, they were deported to the Kraljevica and Rab concentration camps. The camps were liberated by Yugoslav Partisans in 1943. After the camp was liberated, Elvira and Boris survived with the partisans in forests until the end of the war. After the liberation of Rab, Elvira met Vladimir Altstädter, whom she would later marry in 1948. In 1949 Elvira, Vladimir, and Boris immigrated to Israel. They returned to Yugoslavia in 1954.
