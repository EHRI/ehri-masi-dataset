Registration inventory books of all trading and retail activity in the city of Thessaloniki.

In 1925 the Chamber of Trade and Manufacture was established in Thessaloniki. In 1940, it was divided into two separate organizations from which the Thessaloniki Chamber of Tradesmen (TCT) was created. Since then, TCT keeps records on any commercial and retail activity in the city of Thessaloniki. The aim of the TCT is to protect and develop the local trade activity, create networks for tradesmen and promote the economic growth in local and national level.

The Archive of the TCT documents the commercial and retail activity in Thessaloniki. It consists of registration lists of tradesmen that have been active in the city since 1940. It is accessible only by the members of TCT as well as by authorized researchers. Various entries of Jewish activity can be found. The archive is under digitization process. The archive is accessible for research as material evidence of the multicultural history of Thessaloniki before the second world war.
