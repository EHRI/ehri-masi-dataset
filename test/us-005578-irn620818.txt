I'm An American -- Guy Lombardo

On February 2, 1941 Guy Lombardo spoke with Henry B. Hazard of the US. Department of Justice about his experience as an American. He describes the American attitude and nightlife. The band leader says, “In America you don’t have to be upper class to hear good music.” Lombardo tells how and why he immigrated to the United States. He also reveals he, and all his band members, became naturalized and voted together. Lombardo closes the program by stating that because Americans like to laugh, sing and dance, they would never submit to a dictator. Guy Lombardo (b. Gaetano Alberto Lombardo) was born on June 19, 1902 in London, Ontario, Canada to a musically inclined family. Lombardo and his brothers formed their first orchestra while still in grade school. At the age of 22, they formed the Royal Canadians which claimed to create “the sweetest music this side of Heaven.” He launched his career after a trip to Cleveland, when they became represented by the Music Corporation of America. In 1929, his New Year’s Eve Show debuted on the radio from New York City’s Roosevelt Grille. Lombardo and his band went on to secure the booking for almost half a decade. He was affectionately known as “Mr. New Year’s Eve”. In 1934, Lombardo became a naturalized U.S. citizen.
