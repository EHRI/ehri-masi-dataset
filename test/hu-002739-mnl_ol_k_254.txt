In Hungary, a Minister without Portfolio for Public Supplies (közellátás) was appointed in 1940. The major aims of creating such a new position was to exert increased state control and improve the organization of the economic life of the country, assure that foreign trade was beneficial for military as well as civilian purposes, and to have an uniform control and administration of the food supply as well as that of other public necessities. In order to help the work of the Minister without Portfolio, a National Office for Public Supplies (Országos Közellátási Hivatal) was organized. The Trade Office, the Office of the Government Commisariat for Price Control and the Office for Public Food Supplies were subordinated to this new office and were gradually incorporated into it, becoming its departments. Next to the Presidential, there were also Law Preparation, Public Supply Law Enforcement, Mobilization, Liaison with the Gendermarie, Auditor, Press and Information units in operation. The mayors of various town and the sherrifs (főispán) of counties served as local Government Commissioners for Public Supplies. In 1943, municipalities also had to form their Committee of Public Supply that functioned as the executive organs of the Minister without Portfolio.The collection of the National Public Supplies Office includes various documents that are of relevance for the study of anti-Semitism in these years such as the complaints and denunciations of Jews by private individuals or the compensation policy for the sugar the Nazi German Sonderkommando seized in Hungary.
