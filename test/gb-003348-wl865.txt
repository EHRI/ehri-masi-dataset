Provenance unknown

Otto Ernst Remer was commander of a battalion, whose function was to protect Berlin, during the period of the assassination attempt. He had surrendered to the Americans on the river Elbe towards the end of the war.<br><br>In 1950 Remer helped found the <em>Sozialistische Reichspartei</em>, the first neo-nazi party, which was banned in 1952. After fleeing to Egypt, he was amnestied in 1954 and returned to Germany. Several cases followed, culminating in 1994 in a 22 month sentence for denying that the gas chambers ever existed. Remer fled to Spain where he died in 1997.

Copy manuscript account apparently by Major General Otto Ernst Remer about his activities on the day of the attempted assassination of Hitler on 20 July 1944. The document is dated 2 April 1946. It is possible that the account was written whilst Remer was in custody during the period of de-nazification after the war. A note states that the first two pages were missing and that these had been supplied at a later date by a different depositor (G. Fleming).
