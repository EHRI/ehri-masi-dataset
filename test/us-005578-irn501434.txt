Dr. Gisela Laufer Wortman (1923-2013) was born Gisela (“Giza”) Nussbaum in Tarnobrzeg, Poland to merchant Jozef Pinchas Nussbaum and Frymeta Liba Zeisel Nussbaum. She had two brothers, Nissan (1915-1992) and Hersh “Zvi” (1919-1966), and a sister, Sara “Sonia” (Symchowicz, 1928-2017). In mid - September 1939 the German Army reached Tarnobrzeg, and the Jews were marched towards Radomyśl nad Sanem and expelled into Soviet-occupied Poland. The Nussbaum family arrived in Lvov, and in June 1940 the family was arrested by the NKVD and deported to a forced labor camp in the far north of Russia. In the fall of 1941, after the German invasion of USSR and the amnesty for the Polish prisoners in the Soviet forced labor camps, the Nussbaum family was released and relocated to Uzbekistan. During the war, Gisela pursued medical studies in Ashgabat, and in 1945 the Nussbaum family returned to Poland. Gisela finished university in Prague and later graduated from medical school in Vienna. She immigrated to the US and settled in New York City, where she completed her medical internship and residency. In 1951 she married Dr. William J. Laufer. After his death in 1966, she married Dr. Naum Wortman.

Dr. William J. Laufer (1912-1966) was born Wolf “Welek” Laufer Rubinstein, in Krakow, Poland to Meilech “Maks” Rubinstein and Chaja Gitl Laufer. He had a younger brother, Josef “Lolek” (1919-1941), and sister, Teofila “Tosia” (b. 1921), as well as a stepmother, and half-brother, Zalman “Zyga” (1923-2009). William attended medical school in Bologna, Italy and after graduation in 1938, he returned to Krakow. In September 1939 the family fled German occupied Poland to Lvov. All but Josef were deported from Lvov to Marijska, an autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (today Mari El, Russia), where they were imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Josef perished following the German invasion of the USSR in 1941. Meilech Rubinstein died in 1943 in Turkmenistan. Dr. Laufer immigrated to New York City in 1950, where he completed his internship and residency in psychiatry. He married Dr. Gisela Nussbaum in 1951. They moved to Long Island, NY where they owned and directed a small psychiatric hospital. He and Gisela had two sons, Marcel and Albert. His stepmother’s Rheinhold family also survived the war.

Dr. Naum Wortman (1914-1988) was born in Chełm, Poland to Izak Wortman and Helen “Chaja” Wortman (nee Rozowykwiat) and raised in Warsaw. After the German invasion, Wortman fled to the Soviet sector of Poland, and worked as a physician in Szczucin under Soviet occupation and then German occupation. His parents and brother Jozef (1924-?) survived the Warsaw ghetto, and were deported to Treblinka where they perished. In November 1942, Dr. Wortman was deported to the concentration camp at Bogusze, Poland, and in January 1943 to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where he worked in the hospital barracks. When Auschwitz was evacuated in January 1945, he was sent on a forced march to Mauthausen and liberated at Ebensee. He continued to work as a physician in the displaced persons camps at Ebensee and Ebelsberg. He immigrated to the United States in March 1949 with his first wife, Gisela Plancer Wortman (1913-approximately 1960s) and settled in Far Rockaway, N.Y. After his wife’s death, he married Dr. Gisela Laufer Wortman in 1971.
