1

Margot Stern was born in 1930 Bonbaden, Germany. After the Nazi rise to power a few years later, it grew increasingly difficult for Jews to live in a small town like Bonbaden. When she was eight years old, Margot's parents sent her to Frankfurt, so that she could continue her schooling. Later, Margot's parents and paternal grandparents also moved to Frankfurt. In 1941, when Margot was 10 years old, the family left Frankfurt to immigrate to the United States. They first went to Berlin, where they were assisted by HIAS and the Joint Distribution Committee, and then they journeyed through France, Spain, and Portugal before sailing to the United States. Margot's paternal grandparents remained behind in Frankfurt. Her grandfather died while they were en route (in Berlin). Her grandmother was deported to Theresienstadt and died in the east (probably at Majdanek). Margot's maternal grandparents moved from Münster to a senior residence in Frankfurt. Her grandmother died in 1939, while her grandfather was deported and was murdered at Majdanek.

Letter (two leaves, four pages), written and signed by the residents of the village of Bonbaden (part of city of Braunfels), in Hessen, Germany, 9 November 2008, containing an apology to Margot K. Stern and her family, former Jewish residents of Bonbaden, who fled their village and homeland because of antisemitic persecution during the Nazi era. The letter, written following a Christian worship service commemorating the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht in Bonbaden, expresses remorse for the persecution of Jews in Bonbaden during that era, acknowledges the pain that Stern’s family experienced, and expresses shame at the failure of the Christian churches there to have stood with and helped persecuted Jews during those years. The letter concludes with the wish that these thoughts might contribute to the relief of some of the pain that Mrs. Stern had felt, and wishes her peace. The letter contains over 110 signatures of residents of Bonbaden who had attended the event.
