Collection of documents, correspondence, photographs, papers, and artifacts which primarily document the experiences of Dr. Johannes Bielski, his wife Dr. Hildegard Bielski, and their daughter Marion during the Holocaust era. In July 1938, the Drs. Bielski were forbidden to practice medicine because they were Jewish. With assistance from a family friend, they applied for and received US visas and immigrated to the United States with their daughter Marion in November 1939. Marion married Herbert Boxer who had also fled Nazi-occupied Europe with his parents, arriving in the US in 1940.
