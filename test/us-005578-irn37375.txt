United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of three manuscripts regarding the Holocaust experiences of the Gutsmuth and Levi families. The first, entitled "So it Happened," uses family documents and testimonies to describe the experiences of the Gutsmuth family, originally of Giessen (Wiesek), Germany. Through these primary sources, Eric Gutsmuth, who compiled them, describes the experiences of every member of the family, both on the Gutsmuth and Levi sides, some of whom immigrated before the war, others survived in hiding, others of whom (including Flory van Beek) were rescuers, and some who were deported to concentration camps. Also includes "Journal d'Elise et Ludwig Vollweiler de Schluchtern à leur déportation à Gurs," which is a collection of documents, photographs, and text, in French and German, regarding the Holocaust experiences of Elise and Ludwig Vollweiler, who were deported to Gurs and then to Auschwitz in 1942, where they perished. Also includes a manuscript, in French, entitled "Album souvenir Les Levi ma famille maternelle et Sennfeld leur ville natale," which includes documents and photographs about the Levi family of Sennfeld, Germany before, during, and after the war.
