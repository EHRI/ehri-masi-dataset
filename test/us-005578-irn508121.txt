The collection relates to Murray Aronoff and his role as a volunteer on the SS Exodus (SS President Warfield), during the British siege of the vessel as it carried Jewish refugees to Palestine in 1947. The SS Exodus was an excursion boat transporting Jewish displaced persons to Palestine. It was rammed and boarded by British naval vessels. The passengers were forcibly evacuated by the British to France and then to Germany. Murray Aronoff was an American volunteer crew member and was injured, with others, while resisting the British boarding of the vessel. The collection includes mimeographed pages with instructions for repair and maintenance of the ship and a photograph of an injured passenger being carried on the ship in Haifa, as well as, correspondence, speakerâ€™s biography, ticket, and a flyer related to speaking engagements by Aronoff in the United States.
