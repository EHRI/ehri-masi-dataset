SD Klooga koonduslaager

5 records

This collection of documents was found by Soviet authorities in September 1944 in the deserted Klooga concentration camp and was used for investigation of massacre that occurred on 19 September 1944. In 1947 the Ministry of Justice of the Estonian SSR delivered these documents to the Estonian History Museum; in 1962 the Museum delivered a substantial part of the collection (original documents from Nazi-German authorities) to the Estonian State Archive.

This fonds is a small collection of documents of the Klooga concentration camp. Klooga (Arbeitslager Klooga) was a subcamp of the Vaivara Concentration Camp network, subordinated to the SS Economic and Administrative Main Office. Thes materials remained in Estonia after the Second World War and were transferred in 1962 to the National Archive of Estonia, Estonian State Archive. 

The current Estonian title of the fond "SD koonduslaager Klooga" (Klooga SD-Concentration Camp) is misleading, however, as this refers to German Security Service (Sicherheitsdienst / SD) although the camp was during its entire existence subordinated to the SS.

The fonds contains 5 records: 

- ERA.R-170.1.1 - Juudisoost kinnipeetavate nimekirjad koos arstlike ülevaatuslehtedega / Register lists of the Jewish prisoners with medical certificates
