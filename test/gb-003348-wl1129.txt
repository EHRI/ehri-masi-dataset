German Jewish doctors: List of suicides/ murdered

1 folder

Nothing is known about the provenance or authorship

The only background information available is contained in a note at the beginning of the list which states that the list is by no means comprehensive and that it was created from names discovered in an unidentified card index, the facts of whose deaths were corroborated. The note also states that it was far more difficult to find the names of those doctors who committed suicide or were murdered in the early years of the Nazi era.
