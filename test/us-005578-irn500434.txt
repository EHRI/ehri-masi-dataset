Arthur Kerdemann (1911-2008) was born in the village of Kalaharowka, Poland (now Ukraine). In 1917, his family moved to Vienna where he attended school and university. After the annexation of Austria, his family realized that they needed to leave the country, and began applying for visas. During Kristallnacht, while his family was away, Arthur was taken from his home by police, arrested and sent to Dachau by cattle car with thousands of other Jews. He endured harsh conditions in the camp for several months, keeping in contact with his family while he arranged for a visa to leave the country. He had heard that visas for Shanghai were available, and upon receiving one, immediately initiated the process for release. In March of 1939, Kerdemann was released and traveled back to Vienna. His sisters, while Arthur was in Dachau, succeeded in immigrating to England, and obtained a temporary visa for Arthur. Rather than go to Shanghai, Arthur opted for England and arrived in April, 1939. Soon, he received a visa to the United States from his earlier application prior to his imprisonment in Dachau, and immigrated there in September of that same year. He lived with cousins in Cleveland, until he was drafted by the United States Army in 1943. Arthur served with Army Intelligence until his discharge in December, 1945. After his return, Arthur married Esther Haskin in 1951.
