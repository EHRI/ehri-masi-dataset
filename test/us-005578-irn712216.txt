Eddie Cantor radio broadcasts

Excerpts from "The Robinson Newscast" and "Bedtime Story" broadcast by Eddie Cantor on his radio show "It's Time To Smile" (the show was sponsored by a toothpaste manufacturer) broadcast on March 31, 1943. Apart from Cantor, the voices heard belong to Harry Von Zell (track 1) and Edward G. Robinson (track 2). This full broadcast was "dedicated" to Hitler (for details of the full broadcast, refer to www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com/variety/eddie-cantor-its-time-to-smile/guest-edward-g-robinson-1943-03-31). Robinson played prominent role in the touring pageant "We Will Never Die," also in 1943 (see RG-91.0121).
