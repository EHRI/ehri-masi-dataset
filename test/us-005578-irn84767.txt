Abba Kovner (1918-1988) was a Zionist youth leader from Hashomer HaTzair, who played a key role in the founding of the United Partisan Organization in wartime Vilnius. During the liquidation of the Vilnius ghetto, he directed the escape of partisan fighters out of the ghetto, and commanded a Jewish partisan unit in the Rudninkai Forest. He is well-known for the manifesto he wrote in December 1941, in which he appealed to other Jews "Let us not go like sheep to the slaughter."
