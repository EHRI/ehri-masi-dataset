Correspondence with Bamberg, Karl

35 letters

Dr. Charles (born Karl) Bamberg was a Jewish-German physician and refugee in Belgium. After the Second World War he settled in Brussels. On behalf of West German authorities Bamberg acted as referee in trials concerning Nazi medical crimes on concentration camp inmates or forced labourers.

The correspondence documents Bamberg’s involvement in The Wiener Library’s eyewitness testimony project by establishing contact with survivors in Belgium and encouraging them to write down their experiences. Furthermore, the release of former SS-physician Carl Clauberg from Soviet war imprisonment is discussed. Referring to the case of former concentration camp doctor Hans Eisele the idea of compiling a list all SS-physicians and their post-war fates is also briefly touched.
