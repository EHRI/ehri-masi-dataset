Inge Buxbaum (later Inge Rosenbaum) was born on 24 November 1932 in Essen, Germany to Max and Anna Buxbaum. Her father, Max (1896-1966), was born on 23 March 1896 in Allendorf, Germany to Heinemann and Jettchen (née Stern) Buxbaum. Her mother, Anna (née Lazarus), was born on 27 February 1903 in Essen. Anna’s mother, Rosa Lazarus (née Cahn, 1876-1961), and her family owned a haberdashery called Hermann & Froitzheim in Essen. Max and Anna married in Essen in 1932. On the night of Kristallnacht, Max was arrested and only released after he promised to leave Germany. The family, plus Anna’s mother Rosa, crossed the border into Geleen, Netherlands to begin preparations for emigration. From there they travelled to England and then arrived in the United States onboard the SS Manahttan on 27 April 1939. Inge later married Kurt Rosenbaum.

The collection documents the pre-war lives of Max and Anna Buxbaum and their daughter Inge (later Inge Rosenbaum) in Essen, Germany, and their immigration to the United States in 1939 on board the SS Manhattan. Included are biographical materials such as birth certificates, vaccination certificates, passports, marriage certificates, naturalization certificates, and Max’s German Army book (Militärpak). Also included are a postcard and list of passengers from the SS Manhattan. Photographs include engagement and wedding photographs of Max and Anna, Anna’s mother Rosa Lazarus, Inge, and a photograph depicting Rosa, Anna, Inge, and Inge’s great-grandmother Regina Cahn.
