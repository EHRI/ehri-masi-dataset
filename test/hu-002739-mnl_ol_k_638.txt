This collection at the Hungarian National Archive contains a fragment of the documents of the fleeing Arrow Cross Ministry of Religion and Education. This Ministry operated at the Franciscan Convent in the city of Szombathely in the last stages of the war. The collection includes its presidential papers as well as papers of its seventeen departments, several of which are of relevance. However, the most relevant for the study of the history of the Holocaust in Hungary among the papers constitute a separate part beyond the papers of these seventeen departments: it is a collection of papers from 1944 that contain exemption requests from the so called Jewish (i.e. anti-Semitic) laws.
