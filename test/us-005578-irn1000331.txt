Hitler's first speech as Chancellor

Hitler's first appearance since becoming Chancellor. Hitler speaks to SA and civilians at an enormous rally at the Berlin Sportpalast. Some LS from various angles of stadium filled with spectators, with a lengthy and excited voiceover narration from Goebbels, describing the building excitement and enormous size of the crowd. Among the crowd shots is a group of what appears to be Japanese people sitting in a row. A banner reading "Macht Deutschland frei vom Marxismus" is visible time to time. Hitler enters, walks through crowd, shakes hands. Introduced, good sound on "Heils." Hitler pauses at the microphone for some moments before beginning, letting the crowd quiet down and building the drama. He begins quietly, builds into passion. Re: Germans must create their own destiny. He speaks of his experience during World War I and immediately afterwards, and how he came into politics, and his opinion against Marxism. Intermittent audience shots, cheers, "heils," salutes.
