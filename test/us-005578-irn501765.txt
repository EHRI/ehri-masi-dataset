Max Bronner (1913-1976) was born Max Eichenbronner in Nuremberg to Moritz (Moses, 1881-approximately 1942) and Sylvia (Sylveria, 1892- approximately 1942) Eichenbronner. He immigrated to the United States in April 1937, settled in Chicago, and changed his name. Max tried to bring his parents to the United States, but they were deported to Izbica in 1942 with his aunt Frieda Eichenbronner and perished. Max Bronner also unsuccessfully tried to bring family members Maximillian Schaefer and Simon and Gertrude Einhorn, from France to the United States. Simon and Gertrude Einhorn survived the Holocaust and immigrated in 1947.

Shari Bronner (1914-2013) was born Scharika Bergmann in Czechoslovakia and was raised in Nuremberg, where she met Max Bronner. She fled Germany for France in 1938 and immigrated to the United States and married Max in 1940.
