Fritz Rosenwald (later Fred Rosenwald, 1915-1992) was born on 11 May 1915 in Köln, Germany to Karl (b. 1879) and Johanna Rosenwald (née Ledermann, b. 1890). He had one sister, Liesel (1914-1945). Fritz immigrated to the United States in 1938 onboard the SS Manhattan and settled in New York. He had regular contact with his family in Köln from 1938-1941, and he tried to secure a visa for Liesel to immigrate to the United States. On 6 December 1941 his parents and sister were deported to Riga, Latvia. His parents likely perished there, and Liesel was then deported to the Stutthof concentration camp where she perished in 1945.

The collection contains letters sent to Fritz Rosenwald (Fred) in the United States from his parents Karl and Johanna Rosenwald along with his sister Liesel Rosenwald in Köln, Germany from 1938-1941, prior to their deportation to Riga, Latvia. Along with a small amount of correspondence from others, there is also correspondence, affidavits, and other documents regarding Fred’s unsuccessful efforts to secure a United States visa for Liesel.
