During World War II, he was a member of the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army, was among the first to parachute into Normandy on D-Day, and was among the first to jump in the Allied invasion of occupied Holland. He was wounded four times and was decorated with the Silver Star and Cluster, the Bronze Star with Cluster and Valor, and a Purple Heart. After the war, he was assigned to capturing Nazi leaders near Berchtesgaden, Germany, and helped to capture Robert Ley. On May 24, 1945, he captured Julius Streicher in Waldring, Germany.
