Elena Fleischnerova (née Wohryzek, 1908-1998, later Ellen Fleischner) was born to Emilie (née Novak, 1883-1943) and Moritz Wohryzek (1868-1943). She had two siblings. Elena married Eugene Fleischner (1890-1972) in 1933 and they had one daughter, Danielle (later Danielle Carr). Elena and her family fled Prague for France in 1939. While in Bordeaux the family received visas signed by Aristides de Sousa Mendes. The following year the family managed to immigrate to the United States. Elena’s parents were deported to Theresienstadt in July 1942. Moritz perished at Theresienstadt in 1942 and Emilie was deported to Auschwitz where she perished in 1943.

The collection consists of letters received by Elena Fleischnerova, formerly of Prague, after she fled Czechoslovakia for France in 1939 and then immigrated to the United States with her husband Eugene and daughter Danielle in 1940. The bulk of the letters, 1939-1941, are from her mother Emilie Wohryzek prior to her deportation with her husband Moritz to Theresienstadt in 1942. Other letters are from friends and family.
