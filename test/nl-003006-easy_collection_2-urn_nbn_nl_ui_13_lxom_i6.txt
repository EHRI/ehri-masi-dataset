Interview with Regina Zielinski (Siedliczcze 2 September 1924). Zielinski was taken to Sobibor in a horse-drawn cart together with her fellow-villagers just before Christmas 1942. She was selected to knit socks and later had to sort ammunition. On arrival in the camp she heard her little brother say: Let's say farewell to the night, because we won't see the sun rise again.? She was born Riwka Feldman. After the uprising she fled by train to Frankfurt am Main where she worked for a German family as a domestic help. She pretended to be a Polish catholic girl. On 24 December 1945 she married a catholic Polish man in Wetlar under the assumed name of Wojciszyn. On 3 August 1949 the couple emigrated to Australia where they settled in Sydney.
