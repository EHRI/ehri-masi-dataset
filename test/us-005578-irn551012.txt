Copy prints relating to the experiences of the Panariti and Kuonne families in Albania before, during, and after the Holocaust. Mari and Eli Kuonne, along with their daughter Frida, were Greek Jews from Thessaloniki who were smuggled to Korce, Albania by Iusf Panariti (donor's uncle). The Kuonnes lived with Isuf and his wife Niqi (donor's aunt), but when Eli Kuonne joined the partisans, Mari and Frida moved to a remote village to stay with Niqi's family. The Kuonnes returned to Greece after liberation and the Panaritis were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations in 2014. Copy prints depict wartime images of Frida Kuonne (later Matalon), Isuf and Niqi Panariti, and the car used to smuggle the Kuonnes across the border.
