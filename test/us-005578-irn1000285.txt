Children in Third Reich

Unidentified Kinderheim: children, some in Hitler Youth or BDM uniforms. Extremely regimental flag ceremony in front of the house: one boy gives the signal, and all the boys turn their heads and salute the raising of a huge swastika flag. Children at desks in classroom, mostly CUs of children writing on slates (in one shot it is clear that they write in Zutterling).
