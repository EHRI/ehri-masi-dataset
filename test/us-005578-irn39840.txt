Alfred Majzner was born in Kalisz, Poland, in 1887. He was married to Maria-Ruth Tastl, who was from Vienna. They had two children, Edyta (Dita) and Teodor (Todek). Maria-Ruth died of fever soon after Teodor was born in 1918. His second marriage was to Bronislawa. They had a daughter, Lucyna (Lucia), in 1922. Alfred was an engineer in Krakow. In 1938, he bought a plot of land and built a second house in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland. Teodor went to London to study. During the war, he would join the RAF, but he never returned to Poland. Edyta went to Vienna and Brussels, Belgium, to study fine art. After the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, Alfred, Bronislawa, and Lucia fled east to the Russian-occupied part of Poland. Majzner was assigned an apartment in Białystok, Poland, on January 25, 1940; in March 1941, he was in Archangelsk, Russia. The family was later deported, with the other Jews in the region, to Chkalov, Kazakhstan, where Alfred, 55, died in 1942.

Bronislawa Majzner was married to Alfred Majzner, around 1920. Majzner was her second husband; her first husband, Fredek, was deceased. Majzner was recently widowed, with 2 young children, Dita and Teodor. Bronislawa and Alfred had a daughter named Lucyna (Lucia) in 1922. She owned her own glove shop and Alfred was an engineer in Krakow. In 1938-1939, he bought a plot and built a house for the family in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland. After the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, Bronislawa, Alfred, and Lucia fled east to the Russian-occupied part of Poland. They were assigned an apartment in Białystok, Poland, on January 25, 1940. The family was later deported, with the other Jews in the region, to Chkalov, Kazakhstan, where Alfred died in 1942, aged 55. After the war, in 1946, Bronislawa and Lucia were awarded title to the house in Piotrków Trybunalski.
