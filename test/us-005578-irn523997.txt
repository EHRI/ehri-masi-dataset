The Henry and Fay Bialowas collection includes four postcards Fay received from 1942-1943 while she was interned as a slave laborer in Oberaltstadt, a sub-camp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, from her father, Icek Gerschenowitz, who was imprisoned in Gleiwitz II (Gleiwitz-Steigern Judenlager) and from her mother, Hinda Gerschenowitz, who was confined to the ghetto in Sosnowiec, Poland. The collection also includes photographs found by Maks Bialowas, Henry's brother, who survived the Łódź ghetto and recovered the images after liberation. One image shows a group including Maks’ wife Henia, who perished in the Holocaust.
