In the memoir enclosed in the binder, Harry recounts memories of his childhood in Germany, of leaving his family and immigrating to the United States alone in 1938, of joining the United States Army and being sent back to Europe, and of his post-war life. Mr. Goodman discovered after the war that his parents and sister had been deported to Riga, Latvia, in 1941 and had perished in Kaunas (Kovno), Lithuania.
