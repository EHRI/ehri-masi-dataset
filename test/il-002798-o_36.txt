72 files

This record group is a collection of testimonies recorded by David Boder, a Professor of Psychology at the Illinois Institute of Technology, in DP camps in Europe in 1946. The collection is comprised of testimonies of Jews and non-Jews, recorded in various languages and translated into English. The testimonies focus on the events in the lives of the survivors during the war in the ghettos and camps, while serving in the military, in hiding and in children's homes. The testimonies also contain information regarding the rehabilitation of the survivors from immediately after the war until the time when the testimonies were given in the DP camps, the refugee houses or the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and Union (ORT) offices providing assistance to the refugees. website: http://voices.iit.edu/
