Stefan Klinger (1908-1999) and Margaret (Grete) Klinger née Krall (1908-2008) were born in Vienna and were active members of the Jewish community. From July 1938 to January 1939 Grete Klinger served as first secretary of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien (Jewish Community Vienna) where she translated English, French, Italian, and Spanish correspondence. In 1938 Stefan Klinger passed his dental exam in Vienna and from 1938 to 1939 was noted by the IKG for his work as a dentist and service to the Jewish community. The Klingers fled to Brussels, Belgium in 1939. At the University of Brussels, Stefan Klinger enrolled in legal studies courses and was director of physical education. On May 10, 1940, Stefan Klinger was arrested in Brussels, held overnight in city hall, and transported by train to St. Cyprien internment camp in southern France. He remained imprisoned in St. Cyprien until 1941. Meanwhile, Grete Klinger corresponded with her sister Cecilia (Cecile or Lily) Elson née Krall (1912-2002) in Maryland in hopes of obtaining a United States immigration visa. Cecile Elson attempted to sponsor Grete and Stefan Klinger through the U.S. Consular Office in Belgium, but was informed that the Antwerp office was no longer processing visa applications and the Klingers should apply through France. Grete Klinger moved to Marseilles in unoccupied France in 1941, where she was reunited with Stefan. Elson communicated with the Klingers’ friend Matt Gottschank in Brussels, who was able to help secure the Klingers passage to the United States through HIAS. Stefan and Grete Klinger traveled to Martinique and Lisbon, and from Lisbon to New York City on the SS Guine. The Klingers arrived in New York City on January 14, 1942. Elson traveled from Pikesville, Maryland to welcome them and escort them to Baltimore. That same year, Stefan Klinger registered the US Army draft. In 1943, the Klingers moved from Baltimore to Crownsville, Maryland. The couple later moved to Silver Spring, Maryland and lived the rest of their lives in Maryland.
