Robert Lorenz Tumler (1911-1980) was born on 3 March 1911 in Peterson, Iowa to Gustav and Edith Tumler. His father owned a general store in the area. He attended the University of Iowa and planned on becoming a dentist, but dropped out of his program during the Depression to help run his family’s business. He married Margie Marie Fastenow in 1938. Robert enlisted with the United States Army in August 1942 and served with the 139th Evacuation Hospital. His unit arrived in Europe around 6 weeks after D Day. His unit arrived at the Ebensee subcamp of Mauthausen on 15 May 1945 and helped care for the former prisoners until the end of June. Robert was discharged in January 1946 and returned to Peterson.

Photographs, postcards, and a report regarding Robert L. Tumler’s experiences with the 139th Evacuation Hospital and their care for the liberated prisoners of the Ebensee subcamp of Mauthusen. Photographs include depictions of liberated prisoners at Ebensee, Robert in his uniform, other soldiers, and scenes from other locations in Europe. Postcards include depictions of Ebensee and the Burg Altmannstein. The report on Ebensee is a mimeographed document likely authored by Robert that offers a description of conditions at Ebensee during the Holocaust and after its liberation.
