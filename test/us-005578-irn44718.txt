Correspondence primarily sent by Julius and Hermine May (donor Julie Wolff's grandparents) in Frankfurt, Germany, addressed to their daughter and family in the United States. The letters are dated between 1938 and until Julies and Hermine were deported in November 1941 from Frankfurt to Kovno, Lithuania, where they were killed. Includes memoirs written in 1946 in Johannesburg, South Africa, by Josef Wolff (donor Roy Wolff's grandfather), who was arrested after Kristallnacht in November 1938 in Munich, Germany and deported to the Dachau concentration camp. After some weeks he was released and eventually immigrated to South Africa.
