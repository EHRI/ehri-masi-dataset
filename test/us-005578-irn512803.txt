Minna Wiwiecka Wosk was born in Darmstadt, Germany on April 19, 1922. Her father, Maylech Wiwiecka, her mother, Rywka Schottland Wiwiecka, and her younger sister were Polish citizens, and in 1938 they were forced to leave Germany. They joined their relatives in Łódź, Poland and in 1940 were forced into the Łódź ghetto. In August 1944 Minna and her family were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau where only Minna was selected for labor. In January 1945 she and other prisoners were transferred to Bergen-Belsen. In April 1945 the British Army liberated the camp, and Minna Wiwiecka returned to Darmstadt. She met and married a fellow survivor, Menachem Wosk, who was a native of Łódź, Poland. Menachem survived Buchenwald, but his first wife and daughter perished. Menachem died in 1987.

The papers consist of a portrait photograph of the Szotland family and a 7-page, typewritten biography which is probably a transcript of an interview conducted on August 16, 1995, with two letters to Minna Wosk, subject of the interview. These letters are from Dr. Thomas Lange, are written on "Hessisches Staatsarchiv Darmstadt" letterhead, and are dated September 12, 1997, and January 26, 1998.
