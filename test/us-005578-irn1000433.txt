Invading Soviet Villages

Libau in flames. Nazi officer with (moving) camera. Infantry moving into Schaulen. Lots of soldiers on shiny horseback prancing into town. Civilians hand flowers to soldiers. Soldiers given propaganda newspapers "Die Front" as they go by. Nazi soldier lying on ground. LS sunlight filtering through smoke. German soldiers arresting POWs in wheat field. Sparkly light. A few (Russian) POWs limping towards German soldiers. One is clearly injured, shirtless. Sign: "Jonava." LS rubble, church in BG. INT and EXT of synagogue. The narration indicates that this is the only building left undisturbed by the retreating Soviets, and that the Jews were working with the communists to terrorize the general population. Some shots of the Jewish population, including a few religious Jews, with the narration, "Jewish Ghetto types; scum of humanity." Kids roused out of homes (genuine feeling of fear and confusion), rounded up in village street. Citizens greet their "liberators" -- good shots of German soldiers receiving flowers from women. Images of Nazi cameramen.
