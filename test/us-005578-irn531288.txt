Jacques Bodnar was the youngest of three sons of a Jewish family in Vienna. One of his brothers was able to get to Turkey and wait out the war there, the other went to Palestine before the Anschluss. Jacques and his parents were in Vienna, and were trying to get papers to get out. After the Anschluss, arrangements were made to get Jacques to Switzerland, and he was held in a labor camp in Schaffhausen. Jacques was in Switzerland for about 8 months before he left (escaped?) to Italy. He was there for one month and then crossed the border in to Nice, France. It is presumed that his parents were in Italy with him based on the materials. Jacques attempted to join the Foreign French Legion, but was arrested the next day and send to the Les Milles internment camp. Unbeknownst to him, his parents were also arrested and were in Les Milles at the same time. Somehow, Jacques was able to get a visa to the US which was signed by Hiram Bingham IV. Jacques was released from the camp and immigrated to the US in April 1940. Jacques's parents also obtained a visa and came over in June 1942 on board the Serpa Pinto. Jacques served in the US Army and became an American citizen while in the military.

Collection of documents, correspondence, and photographs which document the experiences of the Bodnar family of Vienna, Austria, who fled through Switzerland, Italy, and France before arriving in the United States. Includes a recording made by Fani Bodnar (Jacque's mother), and a visa signed by Hiram Bingham IV allowing Jacques to travel to the United States.
