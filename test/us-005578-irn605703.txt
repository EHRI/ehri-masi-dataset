Julius Meyerowitz (1866-1946) was born to Hirsch and Lina Meyerowitz in Kovno (now Kaunas, Lithuania), before moving to Königsberg, East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) in 1879. There he attended school at the Altstädtischen Gymnasium before studying at Albertus-Universität Königsberg (University of Königsberg) where he received a degree in pharmacy. He married Bertha Mottek (1878-1959) in 1900 and the couple had five children. Julius owned a pharmacy, called the Engel Drogerie, in Königsberg. Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, it became obvious that Julius and Bertha would need to flee the country, which all five of their children had already done. Julius and Bertha applied for visas to the United States, and moved to Frankfurt, Germany while they waited for a response. When their paperwork was finally in order, the couple traveled to Portugal and Spain, before boarding the SS Marques de Camillas in Vigo, Spain. They arrived in New Orleans in December, 1942 and lived with their daughter and son-in-law, George and Charlotte Tuch.
