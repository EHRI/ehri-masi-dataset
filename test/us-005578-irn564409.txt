Ernest (Eliezer) Braun (born Ernő Braun, 1914-1996) was born in 1914 in Czechoslovakia to Josef (1884-1943) and Gisela (née Perels, 1889-1943) Braun. He had three sisters, Nelly (later Nelly Mozes Braun), Hilde (later Hilde Schwarz), and Hinda. Ernest and his family moved to Vienna, Austria when he was three. After the German annexation of Austria in 1938, Ernest was arrested. After he was released, he fled to Zagreb, Yugoslavia (Zagreb, Croatia) where his sister Nelly and her husband lived. By 1941 he had gone to Spalato, Italy, and then Rome. Using a false identity, Enrico di Carlo Bianchi, he posed as a rabbi and found employment translating Hebrew texts from the Biblioteca Lancisiana, a medical library near the Vatican. In 1944 he immigrated to the United States and lived at Fort Ontario, a refugee camp in Oswego, New York. He married Hertha Dershovitz in 1947 and they moved to Portland, Maine in 1949 with their two children Judy and Jeffrey. Ernest worked in the field of pharmaceutical product development and was granted five patents for his discoveries. They immigrated to Israel in 1970. His parents were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. They were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943 where they perished. His sister Nelly also perished during the Holocaust.
