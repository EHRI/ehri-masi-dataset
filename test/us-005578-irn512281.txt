Armin T. Wegner Collection, Schiller-Nationalmuseum and Deutsches Literaturarchiv

As a second-lieutenant in the German Army stationed in the Ottoman Empire in Apr. 1915, Armin T. Wegner took the initiative to investigate reports of Armenian massacres. Disobeying orders intended to stifle news of the massacres, he collected information on the genocide and took hundreds of photographs of Armenian deportation camps, primarily in the Syrian desert. Wegner was eventually arrested, but not before he had succeeded in channeling a portion of his research material to Germany and the United States through clandestine mail routes. When he was transferred to Constantinople in Nov. 1916, he secretly took with him photographic plates of images he and other German officers recorded.

The collection consists of 56 copy photographs depicting the results of the Armenian genocide from 1915 to 1923 in the Ottoman Empire. Images are of children and adults in various activities, corpses in ditches, hangings, Armenians as refugees living in tents in the Syrian desert, and piles of skulls and burned bodies.
