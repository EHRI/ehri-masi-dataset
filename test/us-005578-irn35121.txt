The photographs depict wartime devastation, Myron Moses in his office (he was responsible for Signal Corps supplies), a staged crematorium photograph, the liberation of a French town, a post-war POW enclosure, and a 1944 photograph of American soldiers at Rosh Hashanah services in France. Also includes two booklets, one entitled "Britain", the other "A Pocket Guide to France." These booklets were distributed to American soldiers so they would know the customs of these countries.
