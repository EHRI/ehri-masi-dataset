The Joint Boycott Council of the American Jewish Congress and Jewish Labor Committee was a partnership formed in 1936, chaired by Dr. Joseph Tenenbaum. The Council served as a coordination effort for the counter-boycott of German goods and services in the United States, prior to entering World War II. The Council produced a list of boycotted companies and sent demands to those companies to cease the import of goods from Germany. The boycott movement, and the Council’s work, ended when the United States entered the war in December 1941.
