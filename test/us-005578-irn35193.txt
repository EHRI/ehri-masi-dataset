Consists of one memoir entitled “Angel on my Shoulder” by Miriam Schlezinger, born in Poruba, but later moved to Poroskov, Slovakia. During the war, Mrs. Schlezinger first lived with a Gentile family in Uzhorod, and then with a family in Nirethose, Hungary, before moving into a ghetto in occupied Poland, which was liquidated in 1944. She and her sisters were deported to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944, where her sister Hannah later perished. Miriam and her sister Surah were sent on a death march in January 1945 to Buchenwald and from there, were put on a train to Bergen-Belsen, where they were liberated. She then describes her marriage to Joe Schlezinger, immigration to the United States, and post-war life. Also includes a copy of a 2008 newspaper article in the Tallahassee Democrat about Mrs. Schlezinger, as well as photographs.
