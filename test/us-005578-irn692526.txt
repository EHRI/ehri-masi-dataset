The Bill Carr papers consists of 7 type-written pages of testimony attributed to Franz Ziereis, the former commandant of Mauthausen concentration camp. The testimony was translated into English from German by former camp inmate Charles-Heinz Pilarski. The testimony describes methods used to kill Jewish and other prisoners in the concentration camp, conditions in various camps that Ziereis worked in, a brothel for concentration camp prisoners, the execution of camp prisoners, the capture of American officers, the hiding places of various SS officers, the sexual harassment of women, the plundering of Jewish possessions, sending letters of condolence to relatives murdered in the concentration camps, suicide of prisoners, estimates of amount of people killed, and a last letter to his wife. The collection also includes a photograph of the Mauthausen quarry taken from a high vantage point on the surrounding hilltop. Both items are associated with Bill Carr's service during World War II.
