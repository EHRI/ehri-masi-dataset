Latvian Nationalists massacred by GPU

Bodies of Latvian Nationalists murdered by GPU in or around Riga. Shots of the dead carried on stretchers and lined in rows on the ground, some placed in wooden coffins. Women stand, gathered together, rocking, weeping, holding each other; some CU of their mourning. Some brief, gruesome views of the bodies, including children. Alone, wailing old woman clasps her hands in despair. (Anti-Bolshevist propaganda) Mangled bodies.
