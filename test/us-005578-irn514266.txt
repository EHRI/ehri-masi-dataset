Dr. David Jakubowski was arrested in 1939 and taken as a prisoner of war. He was released then sent to Kutno and Łódź, Poland, and Stillberg, Germany. In 1940 he was incarcerated in the ghetto in Warsaw, Poland, where he worked during and after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. There he worked as a physician for the Jüdenrat's Department of Sanitation and hygiene. He organized the first aid station on the "Umschlagplatz." In total, he was incarcerated in five concentration camps. His mother, father, and sister were killed by gassing in a van in the ghetto in Kutno, Poland.

The papers consist of documents and letters relating to Dr. David Jakubowski's time in the ghetto in Warsaw, Poland, where he was a physician before and during the uprising and also relating to his time of medical service with several refugee aid agencies after World War II.
