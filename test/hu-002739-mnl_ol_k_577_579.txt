The collection contains the documents of the central organs of the Ministry of Justice from 1867 till 1944, however, a highly significant part of the collection was destroyed by fire in 1956. The Hungarian Ministry of Justice had the main supervisory role over Hungarian courts, prosecutors, notaries, chambers of lawyers and their personnel, prisons and cases related to youth. The Ministry also played an important part in the preparation of laws and inheritance cases. Due to the aforementioned fire, only fragments of the original materials remain and many topics would prove practically unresearchable. Among the topics that could be explored based on primary documents in this collection are the personnel of the Ministry and their pensions in the inter-war period, cases of international law or the (re)arrangement of land parcels and ownership. The collection is divided into presidential (K 577), confidential (K 578) and general papers (K 579). The documents address four major themes: there are papers on the administration of the Ministry of Justice, papers on the various organs of the Courts, papers of the Prosecutors Offices and papers of the organs of the Treasury.
