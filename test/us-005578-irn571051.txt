Luba Sheiman (formerly Ida Salomonczyk, 1920-2001) was born in Radziejów, Poland, to parents Abraham and Rywka (Gersch) Salomonczyk in 1920. In the course of the Holocaust Luba survived internment in ghettos and concentration camps in Poland and Germany. After liberation at Bergen Belsen in 1945 Luba was reunited with loved ones from Radziejów. She remained in Germany as a displaced person until her depature for England and later immigration to the United States. In 1949 Ida married Manes Sheiman (formerly Szejman, 1912-1980) in New York. Luba and Manes had been acquianted when growing up in Radziejów. After their marriage the couple settled in the Bronx and welcomed a daughter.

Manes Sheiman (1912-1980) was born in Radziejów, Poland in 1912 to parents Itzak and Masha Szejman. Manes had several siblings, including a younger brother, Michal, and a younger sister, Gitel. In 1940 Manes and his family were forced in to the Radziejów ghetto. He was later separated from his family members when transferred to other forced labor and concentration camps, including the HASAG Rakow steel mill in Częstochowa. In 1945 Manes was liberated at Buchenwald. He later immigrated to the United States in 1949 aboard the Marine Jumper. In New York Manes reunited with Ida (later Luba) Salomonczyk whom he had known before the war. The couple married in 1949 and raised a daughter. While many of Manes’s immediate family members perished during the Holocaust his younger brother Michal survived and later settled in Israel.
