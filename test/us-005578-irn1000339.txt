Jewish forced labor

CU Jewish men squinting into camera, sitting around, jackets folded in laps to display star patches. Star of David patches (larger than usual, for propaganda purposes) on backs of clothes. All the men are cleaning up large pieces of debris from the streets (fence posts, big pieces of wood, metal, some munitions shell casings). Shoveling, sweeping, pushing wagon filled with debris.
