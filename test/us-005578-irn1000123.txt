Hitler with Degrelle & SS

Hitler congratulates SS Generals Lieb and Gille and decorated Belgian fascist Leon Degrelle for escaping Russian encirclement at Cherkassy. Himmler is present. MS, SS General Lieb salutes, bows, and shakes Hitler's hand. SS General Gille salutes, Himmler walking beside him. Hitler shakes Gille's hand, and looks toward Leon Degrelle (the Belgian fascist) who is in SS uniform and saluting. Hitler shakes his hand and then clasps it warmly with other hand. MCU of the same. MCU hands decoration to Gille then to Degrelle. Camera moves in for good shot as Hitler and Degrelle shake hands warmly. Hitler, Degrelle, et al. sit at round table as Hitler speaks and gestures.
