Large banner with the slogan Ein Volk - Ein Reich - Ein Fuhrer [One People - One Country - One Leader], a central slogan of Hitler and the Nazi Party. The hand made banner is very long and narrow, with three foot posts at each end, perhaps to carry it during marches and parades. Nazi propaganda portrayed Hitler, their leader (FÃ¼hrer), as the living embodiment of the German nation and people. This slogan reinforced the cult of Hitler and the sense of destiny that the Party claimed made him the savior of Germany and father of the German people.
