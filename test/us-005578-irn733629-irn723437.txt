Samuel Martin Tenzer (1933-2020) was born Schmuel Mordechai Tenczer on 8 January 1933 in Łódź, Poland to Melech (16 August 1904-18 October 1998, later Melvin Tenzer) and Lea (16 June 1901-19 January 1980, née Telerman, later Lillian Tenzer) Tenczer. The family survived the Holocaust in the Łódź ghetto. Around 1950 the family immigrated to Israel. Samuel served in the Israel Defense Force where he learned how to fly a helicopter. The family immigrated to the United States in March 1954 sailing aboard the SS Jerusalem. They settled in the Bronx, and all three became naturalized citizens in 1959. Samuel served with the United States Army from 1959-1962.

The collection documents the Holocaust-era experiences of Samuel Tenzer and his parents Melving and Lillian Tenzer, all of whom survived the Łódź ghetto. The bulk of the collection is post-war and documents the family in Israel and the United States, including Samuel’s service with the United States Army. Included are identification and immigration papers, and a small amount of photographs.
