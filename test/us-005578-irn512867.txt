Jiri Lauscher was born on September 14, 1901, to Jewish parents Siegfried and Anna Schwarz Lauscher near Prague, Austro-Hungary (Czech Republic). His father Siegfried was born in the mid-1800s. His mother Anna was born on August 22, 1876, in Pribram, to Jakob and Leonora Schwarz. Jiri had two siblings: Frantisek, born October 12, 1899, and Josefina, born in 1906. The empire collapsed at the end of World War I (1914-1818) and Prague was part of the newly independent Czechoslovak Republic. Jiri’s father Siegfried died and his mother married Julius Katz, (1874-1942). Jiri was a Zionist and at some point, went to Palestine and lived there for a while before returning to Prague. Jiri, an artisan and designer, was the technical director of a fur factory. He married Irma Kohn, born May 2, 1904, to Ruzena Kohn. Irma was a dedicated teacher and graduate of Charles University where she studied German. She taught children at the Jewish School in Prague. Jiri and Irma’s daughter, Michaela, was born on December 30, 1936. On September 29, 1938, Nazi Germany annexed the Sudetenland border region of Czechoslovakia. On March 15, 1939, Germany annexed the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, where Prague was located, ruled by a Reich Protector. Other regions were absorbed by German allies and Czechoslovakia ceased to exist. Jews were banned from most professions and organizations. Jiri was fired from his factory directorship. He was a talented woodworker and got a job in a carpenter’s workshop, which made toys and other crafts. Jewish children were expelled from public schools and Irma worked two shifts at the now very overcrowded Jewish School. Jewish life was restricted. There were curfews, few shops would serve Jews, and Jews could shop only a few hours a day. Jiri and his family were kicked out of their apartment so a German officer could live there. They had to move to an old house shared with three other families; each family allotted only a single room. Radios and all valuable possessions were confiscated. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded neighboring Poland. In September 1941, Czech Jews were required to wear a yellow Star of David badge to make them easy to identify. At the end of the month, Reinhard Heydrich, SS Chief of Security for the Reich, became Reich Protector. Regular deportations of Jews from Prague began, with daily transport notices in the newspapers. On July 16, 1942, Jiri’s mother and stepfather, Anna and Julius, were deported. The Jewish School where Irma worked was closed. On September 8, Jiri’s brother Frantizek was sent away. On December 22, Jiri, Irma, and Michaela were sent on transport CK to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, 40 miles north of Prague. When they arrived Jiri was asked his profession. He showed them a wooden toy which Michaela had brought that he had made at work and they were sent onto the camp. The family was separated, as men, women, and children were housed in different barracks. Jiri was assigned as a draftsman in the camp technical department. He became part of a closeknit group of other artists, including Dr. Karel Fleishmann, Peter Kien, Bedrich Fritta, Karel Bruml, and Leo Haas. Michaela contracted typhus, scarlet fever, and measles, and was placed in the infectious disease ward at the hospital. One of Jiri and Irma’s cousins, Hana Mueller Schiff (later Bruml), was a nurse and cared for her and brought Jiri and Irma notes and drawings from Michaela, as they were not permitted to visit. After Michaela recovered, she was able to live with her mother. Irma was involved in the clandestine classes offered for children and taught them about Jewish traditions. In January 1943, Irma bribed a camp guard to smuggle her a tree sapling. She needed the young tree to celebrate Tu B'Shevat, the New Year for Trees, with the children. She planned a secret ceremony with dancing and singing with the children and together they planted the tree, using their precious water rations to nurture it. Other children continued to care for the tree they called Etz-Hayim, the Tree of Life, and as it grew it was a symbol that life goes on. It was difficult to get paper and pencils, and Irma would sometimes trade her scarce bread for supplies. Over 90% of the children in Theresienstadt did not survive the Holocaust. In fall 1944, there were frequent, large transports taking inmates to camps in the east. Around October 1944, Jiri was scheduled for deportation. Irma wanted to volunteer that she and Michaela go with them, but Jiri insisted she not do so, and she complied. While Jiri and the other deportees were waiting for the train to arrive, an SS commander came to get workers to repair a roof recently damaged in a windstorm. Jiri and a few others volunteered to do the work and the train departed while they were still working. There were few transports after that and Jiri remained in Terezin. By early 1945, all of Jiri’s close friends were deported to other camps, primarily Auschwitz, and as the last member of the group, he became the guardian of their personal possessions. The International Red Cross took over the camp on May 2, 1945. The guards fled, and on May 9, the Soviet Army entered the camp and took control. The war had ended on May 7 with Germany’s surrender. The Jewish Council archive was burned, but Jiri preserved as much material as he could and photographed the camp, in order to document what had occurred there. In June, after three weeks under quarantine, the family returned to Prague. They learned that most family members had not survived. Jiri’s mother Anna and stepfather Julius were murdered in Treblinka killing center on October 19, 1942. His sister Josefina and her husband Arnost Saar were sent to Theresienstadt on January 23, 1943, and then to Auschwitz 8 days later and murdered in the gas chambers upon arrival. His brother Frantisek was deported to Auschwitz on February 2, 1943, and killed upon arrival. Jiri and Irma’s cousin Hana Schiff wrote to let them know that she was still alive and had returned to Prague, which was a great surprise, as Irma had been told by an acquaintance that they saw Hana killed in a concentration camp. As antisemitism emerged in postwar Soviet controlled Prague, Jiri and his family tried to emigrate to Israel in 1951. They were refused permission and the family attempted to leave illegally. They were caught at the border and jailed, Jiri for two years. Michaela was expelled from high school. She later passed exams for university, earned a doctorate, and had a career as biochemist. She married, and changed her name to Vidlakova, and had a son. Jiri was a sought after expert on Theresienstadt, due to his personal experience and his extensive archive, and led tours of the site into his 80s. The tree sapling that Irma and the children planted was relocated and became a site of memorial and remembrance. Irma and Michaela also shared the stories of their experiences. Irma, 81, passed away in 1985. Jiri, 88, died in November 1989 in Prague.

The Jiří Lauscher collection consist of reports, albums, artwork, writings, photocopies, photographs, copyprints, and diary entries documenting the Jüdische Kultusgemeinde’s work related to emigration and job training in Prague; the administration, history, and culture of Theresienstadt; and Holocaust-era ghettos and concentration camps. Lauscher collected the materials during his internment in Theresienstadt from 1942-1945 and acquired many of them from friends and acquaintances as they were deported to killing centers. Records documenting the Jüdische Kultusgemeinde in Prague relate to two of the community’s primary tasks under Nazi occupation: job retraining and preparation for emigration. Records include financial reports of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration, catalogs of job retraining course offerings, a metalworking course book, and reports about job retraining. Nearly all of the records in this series are original materials. Theresienstadt materials document the administration, history, and culture of Theresienstadt, with a particular emphasis on the personal experiences of Jiří Lauscher and his family members and friends. Original materials in this series include administrative reports by the Jewish self-government of Theresienstadt and a scrapbook containing the passes, permits, and tickets governing the daily lives of Jewish inmates. Photocopies and copyprints include additional administrative documents such as reports and inmate registration cards, accounts of cultural and intellectual activities in the camp, artwork created in the camp, and the work of some of the camp inmates. Theresienstadt reports include reports written by the Jewish self-government of Theresienstadt and its Council of Elders documenting the organization, population, and activities in the camp. The reports discuss building projects, social services, self-administration, finances, sanitation, the fire department, and population statistics, and they include maps, charts, and graphs. The Theresienstadt scrapbook: “Samples of Administrative Documents from the Theresienstadt (Terezin) Ghetto” includes the kinds of passes, permits, and tickets governing the daily lives of Jewish inmates as well as Jiří Lauscher’s commentary on how life in the ghetto worked and transcriptions of some of the items. Original documents include samples of correspondence, an informational bulletin, food coupons, tickets for cultural performances, food orders, a certificate of vaccination, identity cards, documentation needed to leave the ghetto under supervision, parcel reception forms, and poems and sketches by inmates. Most items related to Marie Klein and her brother and sister Ernst and Rudolfine Klein, but other items document Irma Lauscher, Else Glaser, Irma and Karl Fischer, Hugo Dubsky, Karl Fleischmann, and others. Photocopies of reports by the Council of Elders on subjects concerning the daily activities of the camp such as food, housing, and work can be found at the end of this subseries. It is unclear when Lauscher created this scrapbook. Jiří Lauscher’s original Theresienstadt album included photographs of prisoners, guards, buildings, mass graves, and life and work in Theresienstadt; ration cards, passes, notifications, and correspondence related to Karl and Irma Fischer, Helene Bruml, and Jiří Lauscher; and original artwork by Leo Haas, Malva Schalek, Karl Fleischmann, Liza Ehrmannova, and Bedřich Fritta. Individuals depicted in photographs included Zeev Scheck, Dr. Weinberger, Harry Tressler, Dita Sachscova, Lotka Brammerova, Corefova, Rutka Bonoyova, Karel Schliesser, Fredy Hirsch, and Jakov Edelstein. Many of the pages also included labels or descriptions relating to photographs and artwork. The reproduction album series consists of copyprints of the original album pages as well as photocopies of 1945 letters and postcards from Irma and Michaela Lauscher to Jiří Lauscher, layout drawings of the Hamburger Kaserne, and a partial index to the album that were tucked into the original album. This next series consists of photocopies of index cards identifying various “prominent” residents of the Theresienstadt camp. The cards contain names, dates of birth, work specialization or trade, and other brief biographical information. Karl Fleischmann’s materials consists of copies of essays and poems he wrote during his internment at Theresienstadt from 1942-1944 as well as a brief biography written about him after the war. In his writings, Fleischmann reflects on life in Theresienstadt, medicine, and art. Fleischmann was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and killed. Most of the materials in this series are photocopies. Cultural and literary materials include articles, catalogs, diary entries, essays, memoirs, poems, and theatrical performances documenting cultural and intellectual expression by prisoners in Theresienstadt. All of the materials in this series are photocopies. Reproductions of artwork include copyprints of artwork created by Bedřich Fritta, Leo Haas, Peter Kien, Jo Spier, and Otto Ungar in Theresienstadt as well as catalogs for two exhibitions about Theresienstadt art. Theresienstadt electrical works materials include photocopies of a personal narrative, name list, and letter documenting the Theresienstadt electrical works and its staff. Photocopies of correspondence between Jiří Lauscher and Ulrike Migdal discuss the fates of former inmates of Theresienstadt.
