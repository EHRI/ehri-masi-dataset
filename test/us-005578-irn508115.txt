The Jacob Beser collection consists of meeting minutes of the German-Jewish Children's Aid, Inc., Baltimore Branch, from 1934-1941. The organization sought to bring German-Jewish children to the United States during the Nazi era, with the hope of eventually reuniting them with their birth families.
