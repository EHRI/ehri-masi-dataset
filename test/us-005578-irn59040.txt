This collection consists of selected administrative records from the former French protectorates of Morocco and Tunisia and related files from the “Syria-Lebanon” collection and from the French Embassy in Madrid. The documents originate from a variety of sectors of the colonial administration including the departments of the interior, immigration, public health and welfare, religious affairs, and foreign affairs, as well as police, public works, postal, military, and municipal records. Military records relate to internment camps, prisoners of war, and censorship. Municipal records document wartime aid to indigent non-Jewish families by a special committee (Comité ouvrier de soutien immediate), which requisitioned Jewish law offices and levied an exorbitant fine on the Jewish population to pay for its services. Many of materials relate to the postwar purge of collaborationists, clandestine Jewish immigration to Palestine before and immediately after the end of the war, and massacres of Jews following declaration of the state of Israel, including police photos from the Résidence Générale of Morocco and the Collection of Jacques Beilin, a house photographer there.
