In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the jurisdiction of district 11 of the Independent Order of B’nai B’rith included the entire Eastern Mediterranean region. A lodge was established in Belgrade in 1911, with Adolf Resovski as president. The Zagreb lodge, founded in 1927, was Zionist in orientation, as was the Sarajevo lodge, founded in 1933. In 1935, Yugoslav lodges succeeded in breaking away from B’nai B’rith district 11 and forming district 18 for the Yugoslav Kingdom. Its grand master was Dr. Bukic Pijade. The lodges’ members consisted of the social elite of Yugoslav Jewish communities. They sponsored lectures, discussions of current Jewish issues, and donated money to local, national, and foreign Jewish institutions. In August 1940, a decree of the Ministry of Interior dissolved all B’nai B’rith lodges in Yugoslavia. [Source: EHRI catalog]
