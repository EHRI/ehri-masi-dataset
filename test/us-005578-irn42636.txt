The Jiři Eisenstein letter consists of one letter dated 1942, 6 pages of text written in English to Peter Kussi. Though unsigned, the letter was written by Mr. Kussi's uncle, Jiri Eisenstein, who explained his life from 1939-1942 in Prague under the Nazi regime in very poetic, exact terms. The letter was smuggled out of Prague and sent to New York, where Mr. Kussi received it in 1944. In January 1944, Jiri Eisenstein was deported to Auschwitz, where he perished. His wife, Mimi, was killed in Auschwitz in March 1944.
