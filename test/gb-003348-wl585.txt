Documents re Nazis in Spain

c1030 frames; 1 box

Whilst the immediate provenance of the papers prior to deposit is unknown, it is thought that the originals were part of a much larger archive (some 40,000 documents) captured by the Spanish Republicans from the <i>NSDAP Landesgruppe Spanien</i> offices in Barcelona and other cities. The papers in this collection were probably obtained by the Jewish Central Information Office (now Wiener Library) in late in 1936.
