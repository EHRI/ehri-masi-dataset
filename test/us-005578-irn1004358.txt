Two clips from an anti-Jewish Nazi propaganda film, Jud Süß

01:11:19 to 01:11:33 Suess and the Duke watch a ballet rehearsal from a balcony. The Duke orders his secretary to go and fetch one of the ballet dancers for him. 01:11:39 to 01:11:47 Suess and the Duke at a ball at the palace. A woman lifts the skirt of another woman to show off the second woman's legs to the Duke. Suess smiles at the girl and the Duke removes her mask and asks her why she is crying. [Suess has arranged for the young pretty girls to be separated from the others at the ball so that the Duke can have his choice. Suess himself dances with and attempts to seduce Dorothea].
