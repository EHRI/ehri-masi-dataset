Collection of photographs given to Robert G. King (donors' father) that document the Gusen concentration camp in Austria shortly after liberation. These photos were brought home from the WWII by Capt. Herbert P. Ramsayer (Robert King's cousin) who was a doctor in the US Army and a member of the 131 Evacuation Hospital.
