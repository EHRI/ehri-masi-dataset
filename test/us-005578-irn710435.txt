Nur für Natur | Rusalkas Lied an den Mond

"Nur für Natur" and "Rusalkas Lied an den Mond" Tilophan 254/255. Two art songs recorded in Austria or Germany, circa 1931-38. This may have been an audition recording for the aspiring US vocalist Gladys Miller (Kurt Frederick's future mother-in-law; Kurt Frederick was an Austrian born violinist and conductor who immigrated to US in 1942.)
