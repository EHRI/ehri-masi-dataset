United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

The Carrol Walsh letter was written by World War II veteran and liberator Carrol Walsh to Holocaust survivor Stephen Barry on April 10, 2008. Walsh, who liberated Barry from a train on the outskirts of Magdeburg, Germany, on April 13, 1945, writes about their friendship. Walsh also describes how unworthy he feels when survivors express their gratitude to him. He believes that the liberating soldiers were doing what they were morally obligated to do.
