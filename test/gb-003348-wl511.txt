His Gymnasium schooling was aborted not, as he claimed on the witness stand at the Nuremberg Trials, because he had to find a practical occupation on account of the difficulties caused by the separation of his parents, but, as he states in his <em>SS- Personalfragebogen</em>, because of his desire to be more actively involved in the ‘deutsch-völkisch' <em>Schutz und Trutzbund</em>. Thus demonstrating from early on his fascination for German ethnicity and pre-Christian culture.</p>
