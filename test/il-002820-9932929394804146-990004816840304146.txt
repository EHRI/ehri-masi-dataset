This file contains a letter written by Loosli to the Swiss Jewish community. In this letter Loosli reveals his fears about the approaching antisemitic events as well as attempts to defend his book "Die schlimmen Juden!", which, he says, was falsely accused of being antisemitic. A major part of the letter is dedicated to the Bern trials and how he fought for the declaration of the falsification of the protocols while actively participating as an expert. His final and most important request to the communities is to act as soon as possible in order to prevent rising antisemitic propaganda which would end up losing the trial as well abroad.
