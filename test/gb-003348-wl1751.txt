Jampel family: personal papers

1 folder

The couple Chana Sara ('Anna') (born 1902, nee Stern) and Samuel Leib Jampel (born 1899) were born in Rozniatov near Lvov, Poland. They got married in 1922 and emigrated to Gelsenkirchen, Germany, in 1938. They had a flourishing shoe shop business until the November pogroms in 1938 during which the business was destroyed. Anna was beaten and began living in hiding with their two young sons Hermann and Salo (both born in 1925). Samuel fled to Malta and then to England whilst they awaited their emigration papers for the USA. Anna and the children managed to get visas for England in 1939 and joined Samuel. Due to the Second World War and the birth of their third child Helen in 1943 they decided to settle down in the UK rather than emigrating to the USA. Samuel Jampel soon set up a new business 'S G Mantles Limited' in the UK
