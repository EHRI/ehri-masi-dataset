Charlotte Hülsen, née&nbsp;Pinner (1906-1944), mother of the donor, is the presumed author of the typescript recipe book in this collection. She owned a cookery school in Hohenzollernstrasse, Breslau, where the family lived. Charlotte was deported to Theresienstadt and died in Auschwitz in 1943. The recipe book remained in the hands of Anni Goldstein née Jonas, whose sister, Erna Jonas, worked in the Hülsen family household. Anni worked in the Jewish hospital in Hohenzollernstrasse.
