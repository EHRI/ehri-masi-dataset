Papers of Heinz Werner Löwenstein

5 folders, 133 photos

The collection comprises two separate deposits from the family Löwenstein in 1988. The first (643/1/1) consists of correspondence between Heinz Werner Löwenstein and his parents, 1935-1940. The letters provide an interesting account of the difficulties encountered by a young immigrant trying to make his way in South Africa as well as of the life led by Jewish people in pre-war Berlin. For obvious reasons the letters make hardly any reference to the political situation and the real hardships and dangers of the parents' lives are hidden. The second deposit consists of correspondence from Heinz Werner Löwenstein to Hans and Milly Hirsch, 1941-1943, medical cards, photographs and medals.
