Hana Vosatka (Vosatkova) (1907-1978) was born Hana Goldstein in Ledeƒç, Czechoslovakia to Josef and Emma Goldstein. Her husband, Jan Vosatka, died in 1936, and Hana lived with her son Pavel (Paul Dixon), parents, brother Zdenek, and sister Arnostka in Prague. She was deported with her parents and siblings in December 1942 to Theresienstadt. Paul survived the war in the care of family friends. Josef, Emma, and Arnostka are believed to have perished at Auschwitz. Zdenek died of typhoid fever at Kaufhausen shortly after liberation. Hana survived and was reunited with her son after the war.

Hana Vosatka papers consist of photographs of Hana before and after her internment in Theresienstadt, a photograph of her family's memorial, a postcard from Pavel Vosatka (Paul Dixon) to his mother in Theresienstadt, and worker identification cards, ration cards, passes, and medical records documenting Hana's internment and work activities at Theresienstadt.
