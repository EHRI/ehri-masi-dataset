Contains copies of Placówka, a weekly newspaper for “the Polish village” published clandestinely in Warsaw in 1940. Topics include discussions of the war in general including war news in other theaters and U.S. efforts to build a war machine larger than Germany’s; the need for Polish farmers to retain their land at all costs; the efforts of the occupiers to substitute German and Soviet culture for Polish culture; Soviet deportations of Poles; a speech by the Pope; and plans for the postwar period (assuming the defeat of Germany), specifically that Poland should use German lands to solve agricultural shortfalls.
