Edith Hahn-Beer (b. Edith Hahn, Jan. 24, 1914, Vienna, Austria) was a survivor of Nazi labor camps in Germany from 1941 to 1942. Until the Anschluss in 1938, she was a student of law at the University of Vienna. She was forced to discontinue her studies and, in 1939, was forced to move into the Jewish ghetto in Vienna along with her mother, Klothilde Hahn. In Apr. 1941 Edith was forced into a labor camp at a farm in Osterburg, Germany, where she performed agricultural labor. In Oct. 1941, she and other women from the farm camp were taken to a paper carton factory in Aschersleben, Germany, near Leipzig. During her time in these camps, she managed to maintain a steady correspondence with a former law school friend, Joseph "Pepi" Rosenfeld, of Vienna. There are some 290 pieces of correspondence in the collection between Edith and Pepi that chronicle her experiences in the camps and his support and encouragement for her. In 1942, the Nazis ordered Edith to report for relocation, but she decided to escape deportation by going underground. She sought the aid of a non-Jewish friend, Christine Margarethe Denner. Denner applied for and received duplicate identification papers for herself for Edith to use while posing as a Christian. Living under her new identity, Edith settled in Munich, Germany, where she worked as a seamstress and nurse. In Aug. 1942 Edith met and fell in love with Werner Vetter, a Nazi. After his divorce from his first wife, Vetter and Edith married in 1943. Their daughter, Angelika Maria (Angela), was born on Apr. 9, 1944. As World War II turned against Germany, Vetter was drafted and soon captured by the Russians and taken to Siberia as a prisoner of war. Edith fled with her infant daughter to the German countryside. After the war, Edith and Werner divorced, and he returned to his first wife. Edith became a judge in the Soviet zone of Germany but eventually fled to England when the Soviets pressured her to spy on colleagues. In 1957, Edith married fellow Viennese refugee, Fred Beer. They lived near London until Beer's death in 1984. Before Fred died, he and Edith visited Pepi and retrieved the letters and postcards that she wrote to him while in the labor camps. Joseph (Pepi) Rosenfeld died in the early 1960s. Edith Hahn moved to Israel in 1984 after the death of her husband.

This collection contains correspondence exchanged between Edith Hahn and her fiancé, Joseph (Pepi) Rosenfeld, and between Edith and her mother, Klothilde Hahn, during Edith’s time in German labor camps in Osterburg and Aschersleben. Also included are photographs of the Hahn family, Joseph Rosenfeld, and Werner Vetter; identification cards and passports for Edith Hahn; cardboard cartons made by Hahn while in Aschersleben labor camp near Leipzig, Germany; payroll statements; clippings, letters, and certificates relating to the publication of Hahn’s book, "Ich will leben!"; and various other documents relating primarily to Hahn’s experiences from 1938 to 1944.
