Jakob Kessler (later Jacques Kessler, nicknamed Suzi (by his wife Lizzy only), 1890-1945) was born on 8 May 1890 in Dunajów, Galicia (Dunayev, Ukraine) to David Hersch Kessler and Scheindel Kessler (née Bernzweig). He had five sisters and two brothers: Anna (Boltuch), Elsa (Winter), Fanny (Kleinberg), Sabine (Bien), Perl/Peppy (Kavaler), Leon, and Willy. Jakob served with the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I and was shot in a prone position. The bullet entered his shoulder and exited through his leg. He refused amputation of his partially frozen leg and eventually recovered his ability to walk. After his recovery, Jakob became an enthusiastic hiker and mountain climber in the Alps. Alice Blanca Kessler (née Neuhut, later Alice Feld, nicknamed Lizzy, 1903-1981) was born on 26 December 1903 in Vienna, Austria to Maximilian Neuhut (Max, b. 1872) and Else (née Döry, 1876-1943) Neuhut. Her grandparents, Emil Deutsch (later Emil Döry, d. 1896) and Ilke (Ilona or Eleonore, d. 1922) Blass, converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1888. Else studied Buddhism and was a published author. Her family was also active in sports. Max was “Underwater swimming champion" of Europe and a top water polo player. Max and Alice were also long distance swimmers. Jakob and Alice married in 1926, and she converted back to Judiasm in an Orthodox ceremony. Their son Hans Otto Kessler (later John, nicknamed Hansi) was born on 26 November 1928 in Vienna. The Kesslers were then Jewish, but not actively religious. In 1934 Hans, his mother Alice, and his grandmother Else were baptized in the Lutheran church (Evangelische Kirche). Alice was a professional leather worker, artist, and designer. She also studied cooking at the Grand Hotel in Vienna and reached professional status as a gourmet cook. Alice and her mother traveled to England to a leatherware fair where she sold her leather output, with original designs. Concurrently, she learned conversational English. She enjoyed and read only English novels (mostly detective novels) throughout her life. In 1933 the Kesslers moved to Baden, approximately thirty-five miles from Vienna. Max retired from his position as the sales director for a light bulb company (which later became Tungsram and eventually Sylvania) and purchased the Hotel-Pension Rauhenstein-Helenenschlössl hotel (also known as Haus Lizzy). Alice worked as a chef at the hotel, and Jakob managed the finances. In November 1938 Jakob was arrested and detained in Vienna, and preparations were being made to deport him to a concentration camp. He was not harmed, he believed, because he only spoke in a style emphasizing his military background. While in detention, he witnessed sadistic horrors perpetrated by the Austrian Nazi jailers. Meanwhile Alice went to a library, using her facility with the English language to read the London Times. She found an advertisement for a job for a “married couple”, cook and butler. She long-distance telephoned the people who placed the ad and got the job. She then went to the British consulate and managed to obtain visas for herself, Jakob, and Hans. She used the exit visa to get Jakob out of jail, and within days they escaped by train from Austria to England via Germany and Belgium. In England, Alice worked as a chef and Jakob worked as a butler in Fernhurst, Sussex. Hans attended Midhurst Grammar School, a boarding school nearby. The family immigrated to the United States in 1940. They briefly lived in New York, but decided to settle in Jacksonville, Florida. Hans attended boarding school in Connecticut for one year. Boarding school in Connecticut was paid for by his mother’s Uncle Gaston Neuhut, who had emigrated to the U.S. from Austria before the 1930s. Hans joined his parents after they were able to establish themselves financially in Florida. Alice and Jakob opened a bakery by 1943. The bakery failed shortly thereafter and Alice started a catering business, mostly for Jewish family parties. Jakob, now going by Jacques, worked as a bookkeeper for $20/week for a Jewish business. Alice’s parents Else and Max lost control of their hotel in Baden and immigrated to Cuba in 1941. They came to the United States in 1943 and settled in Jacksonville with the Kesslers. Max later moved to New York after Else died in 1943. He committed suicide around 1945 or 1946. Else had twin brothers Hans (Paul) and Ivan Döry. Hans had been a banker for the Austrian Central bank, was president of the Vienna Tierschutzverein, the Austrian animal humane society. He and his wife fled Austria to France after the German annexation in March 1938, but were later deported back to Austria by the Vichy government. Hans was then deported to Auschwitz where he perished. Ivan survived the Holocaust in Ecuador. Before the war, he was an electrical engineer who worked on the electrification of the Austrian railway system. After his move to Ecuador, one of Ivan’s projects was an attempt to disprove Einstein’s theory of relativity. After graduating Robert E. Lee high school in Jacksonville, FL, Hans, now John Kessler, attended Columbia University on a full scholarship. Jakob died in 1945, and the same year Alice moved to New York to be with her son. She married Berthold Feld (b. 1898) in 1948 and became a commercial artist. Hans graduated from Columbia University College in 1949 and received a PhD in Physics from Columbia in 1953. He married Eva Bondy in 1950. He worked as a physicist at RCA Laboratories (Princeton) and at the Princeton University high temperature plasma laboratory. In 1966 he became Professor of Physics at the University of Arizona. Eva Magdalena Bondy (later Eva Kessler, 1926-2014) was born in Vienna to Alfred (1897-1972) and Emilie (née Rothziegel, b. 1897) Bondy. She had one brother, Michael. Her family moved to Zagreb (Croatia) when she was a child. Alfred was a manager at a Zagreb textile factory. Her family immigrated to the United States via Italy aboard the SS Manhattan in 1940. Alfred became the importer to the USA of BMW motorcycles through his company, Butler and Smith, based in New York City.
