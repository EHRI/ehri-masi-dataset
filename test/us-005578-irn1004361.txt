Munich putsch commemoration, 1938

Commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Munich putsch (beer hall putsch), which occurred on November 9, 1923. Footage of Hitler in Austria after the annexation as an illustration of the realization of the dream of Greater Germany before the narrator hearkens back to the memory of those Nazis who died in service to the movement. Close ups of parts of the Feldhernnhalle memorial and the entrance to the Buergerbraukeller, the beer hall where the putsch was launched. Julius Streicher leads a parade of uniformed men down a street. Hermann Goering and Adolf Hitler are also present. Close-ups of the names of some of the Nazi "martyrs" on the columns that form the memorial are interspersed with shots of the parade. Hitler accompanies SS troops as they lay a large wreath. He salutes the memorial. More shots of the memorial, including the slogan "Und ihr habt doch gesiegt!" (And you have triumphed after all!), and the ceremony, including men marching with wreaths, while Deutschland Ueber Alles plays. Quick shot of uniformed women. Hitler greets a group of women wearing dark coats, presumably the widows of the dead Nazis. A man reads the names of the dead as wreaths are laid at the memorial. More shots of Hitler, the huge number of uniformed party members, and the ceremony. A shot of the sarcophagi superimposed over a shot of one of the memorial flames.
