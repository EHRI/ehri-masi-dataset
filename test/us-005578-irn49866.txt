United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of one typed memoir written by Felice Zimmern Stokes, who was born in Wallduern, Germany, in 1939. In the memoir, she describes her family's deportation to France to Camp de Gurs and being taken to the "La Pouponniere" OSE nursery in Limoges and from there, into hiding with the Patoux family on their farm in La Caillaudiere, France. After the war, Felice reunited with her sister Beate (who also survived in hiding) in the Daveil and Taveny orphanages; they emigrated to the United States in 1951. She later visited Wallduern, and gave testimony when M. and Mme Patoux were named Righteous Among the Nations. The memoir also includes excerpts from translations of wartime letters written by Felice's parents and relatives, all of whom perished.
