Gussie Mager was born Henia Gittel Axelrod (1904-1981) was born on 22 October 1904 in Kolomea (Kolomyia, Ukraine) to Pepi Axelrod (alternately spelled Axelrad or Akselrad) and Aaron Gross. She had two sisters, Frieda Ester Gross (alternately spelled Freda Esther, later Frieda Helf, 1903-1958) and Zosia (b. 1911), and three brothers, Elkuna Gross (1908-1975), Ancel (1912-1913), and another whose name is unknown (1909-1909). Henia’s parents’ marriage was not recognized by the civil authorities so she went by her mother’s maiden name. Gussie and her sister Frieda immigrated to the United States aboard the SS Imperator in August 1920. She married fellow immigrant Max Mager (b. 1897) on 23 October 1927. They had two children, Arline (b. 24 September 1929) and Jerome (b. 12 July 1932). Max worked as a tailor and was a member of the ILGWU. Frieda married Morris Helf and they had one daughter, Lynette (Spira, b. 6 July 1939). Elkuna remained in Kolomea where he worked as a policeman. In 1937 he completed a Certificate of Poverty to receive social welfare benefits. After the start of World War II, Elkuna was conscripted into the Red Army. After getting wounded he was sent to Siberia for the duration of the war. After the war, he resumed his career as a policeman and lived in several displaced person camps. His sister Frieda and her husband Morris sponsored his immigration to the United States in 1949. He settled in New York where he worked as a security guard at the Montefiore Hospital. Aaron Gross died before the start of World War II. Pepi remained in Kolomea and Gussie and Max submitted an affidavit for her immigration to the United States. She was unable to emigrate, and after the war Elkuna learned that she was shot and killed in the street in 1939.
