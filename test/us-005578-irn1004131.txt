Soviet POWs, Jews among them, with antisemitic commentary

A German soldier draws a cartoon of Stalin for use in the "Frontzeitung" [front newspaper]. Shot of a printing press producing copies of the newspaper. Troops dispense newspapers to their eager colleagues. The local population also received German-produced newspapers. Locals stand in a long line to receive Russian-language newspapers. Soviet prisoners of war cross a bridge over the Dniepr river in an "endless" column. Some of the men wear rags and appear very bedraggled. The narrator describes them as a particular (or peculiar?) selection of Jews. A view of the column from a low-flying plane. Good close-ups on individual prisoners, described as the confederates of Churchill and the Christian soldiers of Roosevelt.
