Martin Gelb (Marton/Morton) was born on October 1, 1909 near Budapest, Hungary, to Berti and Terez Gelb. He had six brothers (including Adolph, Markus, and Louis) and a sister, Sare. His brother Louis was married to Rosa Paschkle Kuhlfass. Martin trained as a mechanic and locksmith. In 1940, he escaped through Italy and boarded a ship to the United States, arriving in May 1940, and was sponsored by Rosa's uncles in Cleveland, Ohio. Two weeks after he arrived, Martin married Charlotte Heiser. Charlotte's first name was also listed as Serlota, Sarlota, or Sheindel. She was born Charlotte Hochheiser, but after World War I, the family changed their name to Kuhlfas (Kuhlfass) and later to Heiser. Charlotte was born on April 15, 1909 in Podolinec (Pudlein), Czechoslovakia, to Jacob and Nettie Beckerman Hochheiser. She was one of eight children, including Yolan, Rosa, Markus, Simon, Elka, Dora, and Reisy. With the sponsorship of her maternal uncle's family, she immigrated to Cleveland in 1937. In 1940, after her sister Rosa's brother-in-law Martin also immigrated to Cleveland, the couple married. Martin worked in the Raboy electrical company, owned by a cousin. Martin and Charlotte were the only survivors of their immediate families. They had two daughters, Marilyn and Janet. Martin passed away on August 3, 1958, and Charlotte on July 13, 1987.
