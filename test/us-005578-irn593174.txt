Polska Agencja Prasowa, PAP [Polish Press Agency] is Poland's national news agency, producing and distributing political, economic, social, and cultural news as well as events information. Polska Agencja Prasowa S.A. was incorporated in 1918 as the Polish Telegraphic Agency (PTA). In 1944 following the Soviet entry into German-occupied Poland, the company was taken over by the Polish communists and set up under its current name as the local alternative to the still functioning Polish Telegraphic Agency loyal to the Polish government in exile from 1939 in Paris and London. During the reign of communism in Poland PAP was a government institution and the official communist mouthpiece. In 1990 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of communism in Europe, the company was reformed and in 1991 the original PTA was finally merged into PAP to form the present day Agency.
