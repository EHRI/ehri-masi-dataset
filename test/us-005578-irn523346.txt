Richard Kaufman was born on July 7, 1926, in Karlsruhe, Germany. His father, Hugo Kaufman, worked for the timber industry, and his mother, Hermine Kaufman, took care Richard and his brother, Karl (b. October 10, 1923). Hugo was away on a business trip when Kristallnacht occurred, but Richard's grandfather who was 78 years old at the time, was arrested. In April 1939, Richard left Germany on Kindertransport and later traveled on his own to Hook of Holland to meet a group going to England. Richard arrived in London, England, in May 1939. After spending a few weeks with a Jewish family, he went to a Jewish boarding school where he spent the next four years. In September 1940 Hugo and Hermine were deported to Gurs transit camp. In 1942 they were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp and killed on arrival. Karl survived the war. Richard married Edith Hirschfeld in March 1954 and they lived in London, England.
