Joel Citron collection of family materials

folder

1

The original letters and documents (some of which have been either translated or summarized) from the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigration Aid Society of America and the International Committee of the Red Cross document the status of and experiences of members of Joel Citron's family from Poland. Most letters are from family in Poland asking for help from family members living in the United States. Among those letters written after the Holocaust, one from Itka Radoszynska (dated 4 Dec 1945) describes how only she, out of all her family from Siedlce, Poland, survived by throwing herself off a train destined for Treblinka and by hiding for two years.
