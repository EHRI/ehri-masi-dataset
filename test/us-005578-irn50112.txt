Betty Siebenscheinova (née Rosenbloom, b.1917) was born in Prague to Wilhelm (b. 1882) and Charlotte (née Braunstein, b. 1883) Rosenbloom and had one brother, Max (b. 1913). Betty married Jakub Siebenscheinova (1894-1945) in 1941 and they had a daughter, Desha (b.1943). In 1941, shortly after they were married, Jakub and Betty were transported to Theresienstadt. Betty and a friend escaped and went to Prague to see her family, but they decided to return because they feared for their husbands’ safety in the camp. Betty and Jakub were soon taken to the Lublin ghetto where they escaped and went to Ukraine. Betty obtained false papers identifying herself as a Christian under the name Elizabeth Siebenshein (née Birknerova). After living in hiding for several months, Betty and Jakub were captured and taken to the Sereď concentration camp in late 1942 where they were interned until liberation. Dasha was born in Sereď and stayed with her mother during the war. Both of Betty’s parents and her brother were killed in Treblinka in 1942 or 1943 and Jakub died soon after the war ended. After the war she applied for visas and in 1948 Betty and Dasha moved to Israel. Betty met Walter Steiner (b.1920) and they married in 1949. Walter survived the war in hiding in Bratislava, Slovakia. They immigrated to the United States in 1955.
