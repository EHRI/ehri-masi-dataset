Gad Goldman was born in Kavech, Poland in 1913.

A photocopied Hebrew newspaper article, by an unknown author and dated 07 December 1979, describes Gad Goldman's Holocaust experiences in an unidentified Polish town before the war and in Łódź, Poland. An English-language article by Goldman, "Potatoes for Pesach," which appeared in the Spring 1974 issue of "Adventure in Jewish Life", describes how he and some inmates of Schottenberg concentration camp decided to observe the Jewish holiday of Passover despite the risk of punishment. The photocopy of Goldman's work card from the Litzmannstadt (a.k.a. Łódź) ghetto includes his worker number, a photograph, and other information.
