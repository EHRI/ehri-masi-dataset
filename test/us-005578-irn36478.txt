Consists of one memoir, 19 pages, entitled "My Story," by Helen Lewi (later Helen Martel), originally of Sosnowiec, Poland. In the memoir, she describes her childhood, the invasion of Poland, the 1942 deportations, life in the ghetto, her deportation (without her family) to a labor camp in Zillerthal-Erdmannsdorf in 1943, deportation to an unknown concentration camp in 1944, and deportation to the Gablonz concentration camp in 1945. She was liberated there by the Red Army; she returned to Sosnowiec and discovered that almost her entire family had perished, except for her brother and a cousin. Also includes copies of group photographs taken immediately after the war and a copy of a photograph of Helen Martel in Paris in 1947-1948 with her infant daughter, Madeleine.
