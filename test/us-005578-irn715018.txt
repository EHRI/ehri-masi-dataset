Adolf Rosenfeld (1898-1942) was born on June 16, 1898 in Korb, Germany. He married Katherine Rosenfeld (née Lemberger, 1899-1942) who was born on July 18, 1899 in Rexingen, Germany. Adolf served in World War I during which he lost his leg. After the war, Adolf worked as a cattle dealer and livestock trader in Adelsheim, Germany. In 1937, the Rosenfelds sent their daughters, Bertha, Edith, and Ruth Rosenfeld to live with their aunt Friederika Lemberger in Aachen, Germany, where they attended a Jewish school. In March 1939, the three girls were sent to Great Britain on a Kindertransport. Their youngest daughter, two year old Esther, was sent on a Kindertransport to Great Britian in June 1939. The Rosenfeld family had relatives in the United States who signed affidavits of support for the family. However, due to the strict immigration quotas, it was not possible to get visas for everyone. The extended family made the decision to send an uncle’s family to the United States. On October 22, 1940, Adolf and Katherine Rosenfeld and their son Herman Rosenfeld were arrested by the Gestapo in Adelsheim and deported to Gurs internment camp in France. On March 30, 1941, they were transferred to Rivesaltes internment camp. Herman, age eight, was rescued from Rivesaltes in September 1941 and sent by private relief efforts to live with an uncle in the United States. On August 2, 1942, Adolf and Katherine Rosenfeld were sent from Rivesaltes to Drancy transit camp in Paris. From there, they were deported to Auschwitz concentration on August 14, 1942. Adolf Rosenfeld died at Auschwitz on August 31, 1942. Katherine Rosenfeld, along with other family members, also perished at Auschwitz. Bertha (Bertl) Rosenfeld (later Bertha Esenstad, 1925- ) was born on October 28, 1925 in Korb, Germany. In 1937, Bertha and her sisters Edith and Ruth were sent to live with their aunt Friederika Lemberger in Aachen, Germany where they attended a Jewish school. During Kristallnacht, the girls witnessed the burning of their synagogue and were informed that their school had closed. A maternal aunt, Hannah (Johanna) lived in London and arranged for families to take in the Rosenfeld sisters. In March 1939, at the age of 14, Bertha was sent on a Kindertransport to Great Britain along with her sisters Edith and Ruth Rosenfeld. Bertha initially lived with a non-Jewish family, the Poole’s, near London. After the war began, she lived in Scotland. In 1941 Bertha turned sixteen and her aunt found her a room and a job in London. Bertha saved her money and sent what she could to her parents. In 1942, the Quakers working at Rivesaltes camp returned Bertha’s money because her parents were no longer there. It was not until after the war ended that the Rosenfeld sisters learned that their parents had died at Auschwitz concentration camp. In 1947, Bertha and her sisters joined their brother, Herman Rosenfeld, in the United States. In 1954, Bertha married Morris Esenstad, a World War II veteran, and they had two children, Alan Esenstad and Jeri Twigg. Edith Rosenfeld (later Edith Kaye, 1927-1998) was born on February 17, 1927 in Adelsheim, Germany. In 1937, Edith and her sisters Bertha and Ruth were sent to live with their aunt Friederika Lemberger in Aachen, Germany where they attended a Jewish school. During Kristallnacht, the girls witnessed the burning of their synagogue and were informed that their school had closed. A maternal aunt, Hannah (Johanna) lived in London and arranged for families to take in the Rosenfeld sisters. In March 1939, at the age of 10, Edith was sent on a Kindertransport to Great Britain along with her sisters Bertha and Ruth Rosenfeld. Edith was placed with a Jewish family in London. Edith served as a member of the British Army. In 1948, after she was discharged from the army, Edith joined her sisters and brother in the United States. Edith Kaye died in 1998.

In March 1939, at the age of 7, Ruth was sent on a Kindertransport to Great Britain along with her sisters Bertha and Edith Rosenfeld.

Her sisters soon joined them. Ruth married David Hirsch Ezekiel in 1952. They had three children, Aaron B. Ezekiel, Rachel Fishbein Ezekiel, and Tamar E. Granor. Ruth Ezekiel died in 2009.

Upon arriving in London, Esther was met by a woman from the Quaker society who escorted her from London to Thorpe, Norwich, about 100 miles away from London. Esther was placed with Dorothy and Harry Harrison and their son Alan. Harry worked in a shoe factory that was owned by a Jewish family. He had responded to a flyer on the factory bulletin board advertising a need for foster families for refugee children. Upon her arrival, Esther was quarantined because she had scarlet fever, but her foster brother Alan played with her through the window. Esther went to school and had a happy childhood with the Harrisons, despite the effects of the war. Her sisters lived in different areas of England but would visit whenever possible. Esther lived with the Harrisons until 1947 when she immigrated to the United States with her sisters. She married Fred Starobin (1925-2011) and they had two daughters, Deborah Armstrong and Judith Okenfuss. Herman Rosenfeld (1933-1990) was born on April 27, 1933 in Adelsheim, Germany. On October 22, 1940, Herman and his parents were arrested by the Gestapo in Adelsheim and deported to the Gurs internment camp in France. On March 30, 1941, they were transferred to Rivesaltes internment camp. Herman, age eight, was rescued from Rivesaltes in September 1941 and sent by private relief efforts to the United States. His uncles, Sali Rosenfeld and Sigmund Rosenfeld, both residents of Washington, DC, saw Herman's name in a list of refugees published in an American German newspaper. Afterwards Herman went to live with his uncle Sali and his wife. In 1947 and 1948, Herman was reunited with his sisters who joined him in the United States from Great Britain. Eventually Herman married Irene Rosenfeld. They had three daughters Karla Rosenfeld, Renee Rosenfeld, and Stacey Rosenfeld. Herman Rosenfeld died in 1990.

In March 1939, the three Rosenfeld siblings were sent on a Kindertransport to Great Britain.

Friederika died of tuberculosis at a Jewish hospital on March 27, 1941.
