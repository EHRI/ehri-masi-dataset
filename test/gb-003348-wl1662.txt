1 folder

Sally Gossels was born on 13 January 1878 in Emden and Malchen ('Amalie') Gossels-Meijer on 28 April 1878 in Bentheim. Both lived in Borculo, Gelderland, Holland during the Second World War and were captured and transferred to Auschwitz concentration camp on 30 November 1942. Their children Karl, Ruth and Dina were living in Bradford, Yorkshire, UK at the time. It is likely that Miss Helene Meyer (born 14 February 1876), sister of Malchen and living with her in Borculo, was also sent to Auschwitz.

Collection of correspondence between members of the Gossels family who emigrated to Holland during the Second World War and certificates of incarceration at Auschwitz concentration camp for the parents Sally and Malchen Gossels (1662/1).
