Moritz and Berta Jacobson lived in Liepāja, Latvia and had five children: Arthur, Jacob, Issie, Necha (Nanny), and Paula. Nanny remained in Liepāja with her husband, Meyer David, but her siblings all left Latvia for South Africa before World War I: Issie to Durban; Arthur to Pretoria; Jacob to Johannesburg; and Paula to the small Transvaal town of Carolina. Paula married Israel Sandler from Lithuania, and in 1937 their daughter Milly married Jack Bennie whose family was also from Lithuania.

Meyer David (1882-1960) was a banker and lived in Liepāja, Latvia with his wife, Necha (Nanny) Jacobson David (1882-1956). The couple is believed to have been exiled to Siberia (Kazachinskoye, Krasnoyarsk province) in the weeks before the German attack on the USSR in 1941, to have escaped in April 1947, and to have been sent back to Siberia in October 1950. Nanny died in Kazachinskoye in 1956. Meyer visited family members in Minsk and Tallinn before settling in Nemenčinė, where he died in 1960. Most of his relatives were killed in the Holocaust.

The Jacobson and David families papers consist of correspondence, photographs, and poetry books documenting the Jacobson and David families of Liepāja, Latvia; Paula Jacobson Sandler’s youth in Liepāja; Meyer and Nanny David’s exile to Siberia; and Meyer David’s last years in Minsk, Tallinn, and Nemenčinė. Correspondence is primarily addressed to Paula Sandler and her daughter Milly Bennie in South Africa from Meyer and Nanny David in Europe and documents the Davids’ refuge in Riga during World War I, pre-World War II Europe described as a powder keg, the Davids’ postwar life in Saldus, their second Siberian exile in Kazachinskoye (Krasnoyarsk province), Nanny’s death, and Meyer’s visits to relatives in Minsk and Tallinn before settling in Nemenčinė. Photographs depict Meyer and Nanny David and Moritz Jacobson. Two poetry books documenting Paula Jacobson Sandler’s youth in Latvia.
