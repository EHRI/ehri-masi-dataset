Caroline Woolsey Ferriday (1902-1990) was the only child of Henry Ferriday, a New York dry goods merchant, and Eliza Woolsey Ferriday. After a brief acting career on Broadway, she began working as a volunteer at the French consulate in New York City. During World War II she raised money to assist French children, particularly war orphans. After the war, she aided victims of pseudo-scientific experiments conducted at Nazi concentration camps, including the sulfonamide experiments at Ravensbrück and the experiments conducted in Block 10 at Auschwitz, who sought compensation from the Federal Republic of Germany. Following a 1950 United Nations Economic and Social Council resolution, the Bonn government decided in July 1951 to offer “effective assistance” to the victims. The UN acted as an intermediary to Bonn, the Association des déportées et internées de la Résistance (ADIR) in France transmitted applications to the UN, and Ferriday became involved as the Friends of the ADIR liaison in New York. The German payouts were insufficient, and Ferriday pushed for larger awards. In 1958 she convinced Norman Cousins to publish an article about the Ravensbrück sulfonamide victims in The Saturday Review. These victims were Polish female political prisoners who endured horrendous suffering at the hands of Dr. Karl Gebhardt, Dr. Fritz Fischer, Dr. Herta Oberheuser, and others. The German doctors sliced their legs open and inserted foreign substances to imitate the effects of shrapnel wounds. Germany initially refused to grant these women compensation for their injuries on the grounds that the Bonn government did not have diplomatic relations with Poland. Cousins’ article garnered a great deal of interest and support among the public. Dr. William M. Hitzig and a group of Polish doctors examined the victims in Warsaw in September 1958 and selected thirty-five to visit the United States to benefit from medical treatment. In 1959 the Friends of the ADIR hired Benjamin Ferencz to negotiate for financial relief from the German government for the Polish victims of Nazi experiments, and in 1961 the German government finally awarded compensation to be paid to the victims via the International Committee of the Red Cross. Ferriday also encouraged friends in the British medical establishment to bring pressure to bear on German medical authorities for the revocation of Dr. Herta Oberheuser's license to practice. Oberheuser was a physician at Ravensbrück responsible for many of the experiments. Oberheuser had resumed her medical practice as a pediatrician after her release from prison for crimes against humanity, but her medical license was revoked in 1960.

The Caroline Ferriday collection includes applications for reparations, medical records, photographs, correspondence, and printed material documenting survivors of Nazi pseudo-scientific experiments in concentration camps, particularly the sulfonamide experiments on Polish female political prisoners at Ravensbrück, and Ferriday’s efforts to help the victims receive medical care in America and reparations from the German government. Dr. Karl Gebhardt, Dr. Fritz Ficher, Dr. Herta Oberheuser, and others conducted the Ravensbrück experiments, which were supposedly designed to test the efficacy of sulfonamide drugs on wounds likely to be sustained in combat. The victims suffered the removal of bone mass from their lower legs and the insertion of septic materials including glass, dirt, and infected rags into the wounds. The first series, “Applications” include questionnaires completed by experiment victims between 1957 and 1961 seeking reparations from the Federal Republic of Germany. The applications described the injuries they suffered at Ravensbrück and were submitted to the German government via the Friends of the ADIR and the United Nations. The applications are accompanied by related correspondence and testimonies. A few of the files include photographs. The second series, “Medical records and photographs” include medical records documenting the experiment victims in 1959 and 1960, photocopies of 1951 reports submitted shortly after Bonn agreed to consider reparations for experiment victims, and name lists of victims. The series also includes photographs from the collective medical examination of experiment victims in Warsaw in 1958, of their visit with Cardinal Spellman in America in 1959, and of Auschwitz and the experiments conducted there in Block 10. Correspondence files include correspondence among Caroline Ferriday, the Association des déportées et internées de la Résistance (ADIR) in France, the Friends of ADIR in New York, United Nations officials, the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy in Poland (ZBOWID), and the Ravensbrück experiment victims committee. The correspondence documents Caroline Ferriday’s interest in the efforts of Nazi experiment victims to receive reparations for their suffering and her work facilitating their claims to the German government. It further documents the interest in their cause generated by Norman Cousins’ 1958 article in The Saturday Review, the victims’ visit to America in 1958 and 1959, and the 1961 decision by the German government to award compensation to the victims via the International Committee of the Red Cross. Many of the photocopies in this series appear to have been created using a gelatin dye transfer process. News reports and published materials include clippings and reports documenting pseudo-scientific experiments conducted at Nazi concentration camps, efforts to obtain reparations from the Federal Republic of Germany for those victims, and the Ravensbrück experiment victims’ visit to America.
