Sara Zyskind (Sara Plager-Zyskind, 1927-1995) was born in Łódź to Anschel (Anszel) Kalman Plager (1897–1943) and Mindla (née Biederman, 1900–1940). Following the German invasion of Poland, Sara’s family was forced into the Łódź ghetto, where both of her parents died. She was deported to Auschwitz in August 1944, transferred to Mittelsteine, an all-female subcamp of the Gross-Rosen, and then to Grafenort, where she and fellow pris¬on¬ers were forced to build trenches against the advancing Soviet forces. She immigrated to Palestine in 1947. She fought alongside Eliezer Zyskind (1925-) in the First Arab-Israeli War of 1948 and married him at the end of the year. She died in Tel-Aviv.
