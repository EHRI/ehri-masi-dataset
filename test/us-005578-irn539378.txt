Randolph. L. Braham was born Adolf Ábrahám in Bucharest, Romania, in 1922. He was raised in the Transylvanian town Dej (Dés). During World War II his home town was under Hungarian administration, and in 1943 he was drafted into a forced labor unit. His family was deported in 1944 and perished. Towards the end of the war Braham and his friends fled their labor company unit and hid in the barn of István Novák, a Hungarian farmer. Braham immigrated to the United States shortly after the war’s end and earned his M.A. degree in 1949 at the City College of New York and his Ph.D. in 1952 at the New School for Social Research. He is author and editor of several books, notably The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary, first published in 1981.

The Randolph Braham collection consists of research material collected by Randolph L. Braham, world renowned expert on the Holocaust in Hungary. Includes materials relevant to the Holocaust and its aftermath in Eastern Europe in general, and in Hungary and Romania in particular; trials against suspected war criminals; the revival of extreme right ideologies; and biographical and academic information pertaining to the donor. Nearly all of the Holocaust-era records are reproductions.
