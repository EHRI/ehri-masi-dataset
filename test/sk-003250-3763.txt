Documents of the Ministry of Economy were processed and sorted in 1964 by František Bielik and Július Urbanovič.

Ministry of Economy was created in October 1938, during the period of autonomy of Slovakia within Czecho-Slovak Republic (6 October 1938 - 14 March 1939). After the creation of Slovak State (March 1939) Ministry of Economy became one of the government bodies of the new state. Ministry of economy managed economic affairs of Slovakia in 1939-1945, especially industry, domestic and international trade affairs and policy and forestry.   Ministry originally consisted of 11 sections which were divided into departments.

The fonds contains documents of the Ministry of Economy of Slovakia (1939-1945) which managed economic affairs, including industry, domestic and international economic and trade affairs and forestry policy. Besides other things, this ministry was responsible for the preparation and execution of so-called aryanisation of the enterprise property of Jews until September 1940 when the policy was changed. 
Its documents are therefore crucial for the understanding of early stages of expropriation of Jewish property in Slovakia, including the preparation of legislation (Law no. 113/1940 known as the First Aryanization Law).
