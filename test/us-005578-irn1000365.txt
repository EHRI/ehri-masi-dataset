Goebbels speaks on Jewish press

Goebbels (in non-military suit) speaks to SA and civilians at an enormous rally at the Berlin Sportpalast, during Hitler's first public appearance since becoming Chancellor. Some LS pans of crowded stadium. Speech warns the anti-Nazi press to watch out, as they now won't be able to avoid the emergency decrees and restrictions, now their "lying Jewish mouths will be silenced. Now the Nazis will show them how propaganda can really work, with a government behind it." Crowd yells "Heil" and rises to its feet.
