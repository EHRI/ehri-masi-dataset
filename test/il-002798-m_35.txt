32 files, 307 Microfilm reels

Established at the height of World War II, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (EAK - Yevreyskiy antifashistskiy komitet) was a Soviet Jewish organization set up in order to provide assistance to the Soviet Union in its war against Nazi Germany.  Headed by the actor and theatrical director Solomon (Shloyme) Mikhoels as Committee Chairman and Shakhne Epshteyn, the newspaperman, as Secretary, the Committee was established at the initiative of the Soviet Secret Police in Samara in 1942.  

The purpose of the Committee was to promote matters related to the Soviet Union during the war through the Jews living in the United States.  Jewish public figures who were loyal to the regime made contact with foreign representations in Samara, and through them, they were able to reach the British and American governments.  

The JAF arranged trips for its emissaries to western countries in order to influence the policy makers in these countries.  To this end, the emissaries were supposed to arouse public opinion among the western Jews so they would influence their governments to aid the Soviet Union.  The Committee moved to Moscow in 1943, and became an important Yiddish cultural center in the Soviet Union during the war.  The Committee succeeded in raising funds for the Red Army from the Jewish communities in the west.
