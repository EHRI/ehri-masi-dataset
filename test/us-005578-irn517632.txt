The collection consists of three photographs of Leslie (Laszlo) Aigner with his immediate family in Nové Zámky, Czechoslovakia, in May 1944. Soon afterwards, Leslie was deported to Auschwitz where his mother and little sister, Marika, were murdered, was transferred to Landsberg-Kaufering, and was liberated from Dachau. His father and sister, Elisabet, were taken to a forced labor camp in Hungary, where they survived the war. In the photographs, Leslie is wearing the Star of David.
