Ferenc Klopfer was a medical doctor, who was arrested and deported from Felsoviso, Hungary on May 22, 1944, and sent to Auschwitz. After being assigned to hard labor, he was subsequently sent to Buchenwald, where he worked in a factory. When a kapo had noticed that he was a physician, he was reassigned to the camp hospital. In early 1945, he was sent with other prisoners on a death march to Theresienstadt, where he arrived on April 21, 1945, and he and other inmates narrowly escaped mass execution by the SS, due to the intervention of the Red Cross, prior to the camp's liberation.

Consists of photocopied documents from Dr. Ferenc Klopfer, including a handwritten memoir of Klopfer's experiences in Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Theresienstadt, written in the latter location after liberation in May 1945. A separate text describes in more detail events during the death march from Buchenwald to Theresienstadt in early 1945. Also included is a photocopy of the surviving portion of a list of patients treated by Klopfer in the hospital at Buchenwald, with names of patients, including their birthdates and places of birth, dates of their deaths, as well as diagnoses and causes of their deaths. The originals of these documents are at the Yad Vashem Archives in Israel.
