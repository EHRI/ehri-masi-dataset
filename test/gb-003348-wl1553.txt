Ingeborg Samson: booklet of anti-nazi jokes

1 folder

The book had been the property of Kitty Fehr, sister of the depositor, who collected them and smuggled them to Great Britain as a 15 year old girl in 1939. She added a few more during the war in England.

This collection consists of a notebook containing hand-written, mostly ant-nazi jokes in Suetterlin script and a modern transcript of the same.
