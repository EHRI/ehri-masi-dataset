Emil Lissberger (1873-1942) married Klara Sämann in 1899 in Sugenheim, Germany. They had one son, Moritz (Maurice) in 1901. Emil worked at a Savings and Loan Bank in Creglingen, Bavaria. Moritz grew up to marry Bettina (Bella) Grünfeld in 1928. Between 1939 and 1940, Moritz and Bettina were able to obtain visas and immigrate to the United States. Emil and Klara, however, were not as fortunate, and were arrested in 1942. They were transported to Theresienstadt, where Emil was killed soon after arrival. Klara survived her internment, and was liberated in 1945. Bettina’s older sister, Betty Grünfeld, who was employed as a nurse, was killed in Auschwitz.

The Lissberger family papers contains mainly identification and documentation papers for Moritz, Bettina, Klara, and Emil. Included in this collection are marriage, birth, and death certificates, certificates of good conduct, inoculation papers, transport orders, witness declarations, and school records. Other items include correspondence with foreign consulates and post-war restitution paperwork. Also included are personal items, including correspondence, photographs, a wedding invitation for Moritz and Bettina, and Bettina’s school diary, memory book, and Hebrew lesson notebook.
