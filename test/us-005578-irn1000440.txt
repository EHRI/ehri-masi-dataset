Lemberg/Lvov massacre

Brief HA pan of city of Lvov. In bright sun, Jewish men (some bearded, with yarmulkes) are forced to carry and lay out the bodies of those murdered by the GPU/NKVD [not Jewish victims]. Very gruesome: some corpses have no heads, some are bloated, disintegrating bodies. MS pans of bodies splayed out. SS soldiers look on, clutching kerchiefs to their mouths.
