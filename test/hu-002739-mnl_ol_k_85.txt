The records of the Hungarian Consulate General in Brussels contain documents from the years 1931 to 1946, some of which are of relevance for the history of the Holocaust. The large majority of the relevant files concern  citizenship questions of Hungarian Jewish individuals. They include cases of people from territories that Hungary (re)acquired between 1938 and 1941. Some of the files document the screening procedures of Hungarian Jewish individuals who were planning to return to Hungary. There are  some requests of passports and visa in the collection. Last but not least, there are  documents discussing the anti-Semitic measures adopted in Belgium.
