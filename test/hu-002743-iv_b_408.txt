1121,09 linear metres
Textual records

Due to several instances of archival sorting and war damage, a significant part of the collection has been lost, especially the records from the era before 1914. The collection was taken to the Pest County State Archives in 1950.

Subprefect (alispán) was the chief of the administration of Hungarian counties between 1870 and 1950. Elected by the municipal committees for a term of 6 years, subprefects were granted independent general administrative rights by Act 42 of 1870. The administrative power and authority of subprefects were modified by Act 21 of 1886, Act 30 of 1929, and Act 22 of 1942. The term of subprefects was extended to ten years in 1929 and they were appointed by the Minister of the Interior from 1942. The main task of the subprefect was the implementation of the decisions of the Municipal Committee and the Small Assembly (kisgyűlés), as well as of governmental decrees. He was the superior of all offices and administrative bodies in the county, except special offices appointed directly by ministries. The administrative scope of authority of first instance of the subprefect included the matters of social associations, regulating the press, and the office issuing passports. Besides, the subprefect was entitled to overrule the decisions of the chief constables (administrative heads of county districts) and the village clerks.

The fond of the records of the Subprefect is one of the key collections pertaining to the history of the Jewish communities and the Holocaust in Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun County. The most relevant parts are the following:
