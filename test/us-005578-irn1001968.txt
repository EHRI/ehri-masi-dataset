Idealized picture of Prussia to garner German support for total war

Reel 6 starts with Maria and Nettelbeck looking down at Friedrich's body. Outside, the battle continues to rage. As large numbers of French soldiers march toward Kolberg, Gneisenau discusses the overwhelming odds with Nettelbeck. He suggests that they surrender. Nettelbeck tells Gneisenau how much Kolberg means to the people who live there. He falls on his knees and begs Gneisenau not to surrender. Gneisenau hugs Nettelbeck and tells him that now they can die together. As the battle continues, the French debate whether they should halt their attack on the city, in light of the peace negotiations at Tilsit and their heavy troop losses. After they stop firing, the camera pans across the severely damaged city, including the church. The people begin rushing into the streets as a hymn plays. (The implication is that Kolberg successfully fought off the French, although this is not what actually happened in history.) Maria walks down to the beach and stares out into water. Nettelbeck hugs her and commends her courage and sacrifice, saying that she had done her duty and not feared death. The scene returns to 1813 with Gneisenau talking to King Wilhelm Friedrich III. The king sees that Gneisenau is right and begins to write a document, dictated by Gneisenau. Gneisenau gazes out the window at the people gathered on the square below and says, "From the ashes and the rubble there will rise, like a phoenix, a new people, a new Reich!"
