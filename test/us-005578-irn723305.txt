Arthur Hecht (1913-1999) was born on 27 April 1913 in Laudenbach, Germany to Adolf and Sessi Hecht. Adolf Hecht (1877-1953) was born on 24 November 1876 in Aschaffenburg, Germany to Mayer Hecht and Fany Süssek, and was a decorated and disabled WWI veteran. Sessi Hecht (née Rothschild, 1883-1965) was born on 27 July 1883 in Hörstein, Germany to Joseph Rothschild and Filipine Hamburger. He had two sisters: Frieda (later Frieda Levy, 1909-1972) and Paula (later Paula Fernbach, 1911-2001). Arthur’s family moved to Hörstein when he was around 1 years old. His family was Orthodox, and Adolf owned a small business buying and selling soaps and cleaning supplies to hospitals and other institutions. Arthur was an accomplished athlete who excelled at soccer and long distance running. In August 1933, Arthur and a Jewish friend were the victims of an antisemitic attack, and severely beaten by a group of young men (some of whom he knew). He was still recovering a month later, but when the case came to court none of the perpetrators were among the group on trial. Both of Arthur’s sisters emigrated from Germany in the 1930s. Paula moved to Palestine in 1933. Frieda and her husband Hermann Levy lived in Mannheim, Germany and immigrated to the United States via Rotterdam aboard the SS Nieuw Amsterdam on 14 July 1938. Arthur wanted to emigrate from Germany as well, but had a high quota number. Around 1937, the Nazis drove the Jews out of Hörstein, and Arthur’s parents went to Frankfurt am Main. Arthur lived in Würzburg, but he was visiting his parents in Frankfurt when Kristallnacht occurred. He was arrested and transported to Buchenwald where he was imprisoned from November 1938 to January 1939. Arthur was released after he signed an affidavit stating that he would leave Germany. After his release, a well-off uncle from Holland who went to London was able to get Arthur and other relatives permits to immigrate to England. Once there, he was not allowed to work so his uncle had to deposit money for him. Arthur remained in England for a year until was able to go to the U.S. He sailed from Liverpool on the SS Britannic on 22 March 1940 and arrived in New York where he lived with his sister Frieda and her husband. He arrived with very little money and worked in a bakery cleaning pots and pans, as well as at his cousin’s tape manufacturing business in Brooklyn. Arthur became a naturalized citizen on 9 December 1943. He was drafted into the United States Army and served in England, France, and Germany. He received a bad shrapnel wound in his neck from a German grenade and was hospitalized. Arthur was paralyzed, had several operations, and had to relearn how to speak. He returned to the U.S. on a hospital transport in November 1944 and was then in a convalescent hospital in Utica, New York. He was discharged from the army on 5 December 1945. On 25 December 1945 Arthur married Ilse Bloch (1914-1968), who immigrated to the U.S. in July 1937 from Mainz, Germany. He returned to his job at his cousin’s tape manufacturing business. Arthur had not heard from his parents in several years, and did not know their fate. He learned in late 1945 that they had been deported to Theresienstadt on transport XII/3 on 2 September 1942 and had survived the Holocaust. He and his sisters were able to bring their parents to the U.S. from Germany. With the assistance of HIAS, Adolf and Sessi Hecht sailed from Bremen aboard the S.S. Marine Flasher on June 6, 1946. Arthur and Ilse had two sons, Stanley (b. 1950) and Allen (b. 1953). Ilse passed away after a long illness in 1968 and Arthur married his second wife, Margot Feldman (née Israel) in 1969.
