1 electronic resource (8 Pages)

All the correspondences in the file regard racial desirable children for the purpose of Germanization in special homes and institutions. Among them is an order to Germanize the names of the children before placing them in German families, a letter from Himmler to Sollmann, sending Sollmann to Prague to discuss the matter of the children spared from the Lidice massacre, that have been found racial desirable. Appendant, a notification from the Gestapo to the immigrations center of Litzmanstadt follows, stating the arrival of 90 unaccompanied children from Lidice between the ages of 1-16 years (the majority belowthe age of 10 years) with the additional note "special care is not necessary". The original German documents have been translated into English. The translator is unknown.
