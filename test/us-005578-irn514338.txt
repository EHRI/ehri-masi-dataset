Memoir tells the story of Lilly Shalit (nee Roth, ex-Abramovici) who tried to escape Romania in 1942 on the sailing boat "Euxin" with her husband, sister, and brother-in-law. The journey took them six months, as they travelled through the Black Sea and the Bosphorus towards Palestine. Turkish authorities would not let them land in Izmir, and they spent two months on the ship in the Bay of Izmir before the British consulate obtained visas for them to Cyprus. Although they wished to go to Palestine, they accepted the visas and spent Sep. 1942-April 1944 in Cyprus, until they were allowed to legally emigrate to Palestine.
