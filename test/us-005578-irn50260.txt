Photographs (12), and documents, primarily from post-war displaced persons camps in Austria, related to Moses Majerczyk and his wife, Ludwika (nee Finder) Majerczyk. Most of the photographs show the Majerczyks with friends and acquaintances in Bad Ischl and Linz, Austria, 1946-1949, with a few pre-war family photographs. Documents include a card identifying Moses as a former prisoner of Mauthausen/Ebensee (1945); a marriage certificate for Moses and Ludwika (1946); and two immigration cards issued by HIAS, showing that the Majerczyks left Bremen on the S.S. Marine Jumper, in May 1949.
