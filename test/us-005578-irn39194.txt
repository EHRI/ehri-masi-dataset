Theresia Bauer (1923-2014) was born in Neckenmarkt, Austria to Josef (b. 1889) and Theresia (b. Hahn, 1896) Koller. She had two brothers, Franz and Georg Koller and one half-brother, Josef Hahn. She joined the Bund Deutscher Mädel in 1937, when it was still illegal in Austria, but hid it from her parents until the Anschluss. Her brothers had already joined. Her husband, Stefan Bauer, a friend of one of her brother’s, was held as a Soviet prisoner of war from 1945 to 1947.
