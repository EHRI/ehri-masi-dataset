Lazar Mann (1902-1991) was born in 1902 in Tarnów, Poland to George (1873-1929) and Rosa (née Keil, 1876-1930). He had one brother, Josef, and one sister, Sabena. He married Helene Schwarz on 8 April 1930 in Tarnów. Lazar worked as a furrier. Their son George was born on 29 January 1938 in Vienna, Austria, and on 4 December 1938 the family fled Vienna for Shanghai, China. They immigrated to the United States in 1940 via the Asama Maru. Both of Lazar's siblings perished during the Holocaust.

Helene Schwarz (1907-1955) was born in 1907 in Tarnów to Joseph (1877-1936) and Maria (née Keller, 1882-1930) Schwarz. She had three siblings, Janek, Artek, and Rosa. She married Lazar Mann in 1930 in Tarnów and had son George in January 1938 in Vienna. In December 1938 the family fled to Shanghai, China, and then immigrated to the United States in 1940.

The Man and Schwarz families papers consist of two family photograph albums documenting the prewar lives of the Mann and Schwarz families in Tarnów, Poland and Vienna, Austria. The albums are titled "1817-1918" and "1927-1937." Included are depictions of family life, vacations, children, relatives and friends, and Lazar and Helene's wedding in 1930. Also included are a small amount of documents, primarily copies of correspondence. The majority of the photographs are annotated by the donor and include descriptions of the fates of family and friends during the Holocaust.
