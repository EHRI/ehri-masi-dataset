Ryan M. Cooper (1945- ) is an artist and antiques dealer in Massachusetts. He began writing to Otto Frank and his second wife, Elfriede “Fritzi” Frank, in 1972 to express the importance of Anne Frank’s diary to him. They continued to correspond throughout their lives. He also corresponded extensively with Miep Gies, who helped hide the Frank family in Amsterdam during the Holocaust.

The Ryan M. Cooper papers consist of photographs of Anne Frank and her diary as well as correspondence to Ryan Cooper from Otto and Fritzi Frank, Miep Gies, Herbert Frank, Victor Kugler, and Bep Voskuijl. Anne Frank photographs include two items Otto Frank gave to Ryan Cooper. One is a photograph of Anne Frank at age 10 mounted on black photograph album paper. The image was cut out of one of the Frank family photo albums, and Frank gave it to Cooper in 1977. The other item is a printer’s mechanical paste-up of photographs of various foreign editions of Anne’s diary, a sketch of the outside of 263 Prinsengracht, and small pencil notes in German believed to be written by Otto Frank. Frank gave this item to Cooper in 1973. Otto Frank materials include letters and cards from Otto Frank and his second wife Elfriede “Fritzi” Frank to Ryan Cooper. The letters and cards include advice to Cooper about religion, work, and romance; information about the Anne Frank House and Anne Frank Foundation; planning for Cooper’s trips to Europe; news about the couple’s lives, travels, and health; and thoughts about Anne Frank’s legacy. The letters dated October 15, 1975; March 29, 1977; July 22, 1990; and February 12, 1992 are accompanied by enclosures including a photograph and two poems, a clipping, an Anne Frank commemorative postage stamp, and two additional photographs. Miep Gies materials include letters and greeting cards from Miep Gies conveying warm greetings, advice, and news about her life. This series also includes photographs of Gies, information about her cremation, and a copy of one of her speeches about Anne Frank. The collection includes additional correspondence to Cooper from Otto Frank’s younger brother Herbert Frank as well as Victor and Lucy Kugler and Bep Voskuijl, who helped conceal the Frank family in hiding. The letters and cards convey greetings, travel and health news, and their thoughts on Anne’s legacy.
