Dr. Milton Silver served with the 11th Armored Division during World War II. He visited the Mauthausen concentration camp twice: once as a liberator among the first group of American servicemen to enter the camp and later as part of a medical detail.

The Milton Silver photographs consist of seven black and white photographs Silver took during his May 1945 visits to the Mauthausen concentration camp. The photographs depict emaciated Holocaust survivors, rows and piles of murdered victims, and local Austrian residents forced to remove victims onto a truck.
