Josef (Sepp) Dietrich was born in Hawangen, Germany on May 28, 1892. As a teenager he worked as a butcher’s apprentice before joining the German army in 1911, rising to the rank of sergeant during World War I. In 1923 he joined the Sturmabteilung (SA). In 1928 he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS), and became commander of Adolf Hitler’s personal bodyguard. In 1930 Dietrich was elected to the Reichstag and in 1931 he achieved the rank of Gruppenführer (lieutenant general) in the SS. In 1932 Dietrich founded a special SS unit, the Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler, which served as Hitler’s personal army and later became a division in the Waffen SS. On July 1, 1934, for his actions during the Night of the Long Knives, he was awarded the rank of SS Obergruppenfuehrer (general). Dietrich led his division in the battles of Kursk and Kharkov on the Eastern front and the invasion of Normandy, and the Battle of the Bulge on the Western Front. After the German surrender, Dietrich was found guilty of complicity in the massacre of American soldiers near Malmedy during the Ardennes offensive and was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. He served 10 years and was released. In 1957 he was convicted in a German court for his role in Hitler’s purge of the SA in 1934 and served another 20 months in prison on this charge.

In April 1934, Himmler was appointed assistant chief of the Gestapo. He masterminded the Night of the Long Knives, the purge of Adolf Hitler’s rival Nazi leaders on June 30, 1934. Under Himmler, the SS acquired vast police powers in Germany and the territories it occupied, and gained primary responsibilities in the areas of security, intelligence gathering, and espionage. Himmler oversaw the deployment of the Einsatzgruppen (mobile killing units) in the massacre of Jews and other victims during the early war years. He also organized the extermination camps in German-occupied Poland where millions of Jews were murdered. In April 1945, Himmler transmitted an offer of German surrender to the Allies. When Hitler learned of the offer, he stripped Himmler of his authority and ordered his arrest. After the German surrender on May 7, Himmler was captured by Soviet soldiers on May 20. On May 23, 1945, Heinrich Himmler committed suicide at age 44.

German recruitment poster for the Waffen SS featuring photographs of high ranking SS officers and soldiers participating in their wartime activities. The Waffen SS was the armed military division of the Schutzstaffel (SS), the Nazi paramilitary organization that was responsible for security, intelligence gathering and analysis, and enforcing Nazi racial policies. The SS controlled the concentration camp system and planned and coordinated the Final Solution. The SS was originally formed in 1925 to protect Hitler along with other Nazi leaders and provide security at political meetings. In 1929, Heinrich Himmler was appointed Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader of the SS) and turned the organization into an elite corps based on visions of racial purity and absolute loyalty to Hitler. The Waffen SS was established in 1939 to strengthen the position of the SS relative to the army and German elites, eventually fielding more than twenty divisions and half a million men at its peak. Members of the Waffen SS were selected based on “racial” ancestry. Selected individuals were expected to have an Aryan Nordic lineage and volunteers were accepted from Germany, and later Norway, Denmark and Holland.
