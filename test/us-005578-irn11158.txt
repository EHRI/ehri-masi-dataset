Auschwitz Myth

Auschwitz-Mythos

The poster was acquired by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1995.

Post-period poster published in 1995, juxtaposing photos of emaciated concentration camp victims with a short editorial about the acquittal of two Holocaust deniers in Hamburg, Germany. In February 1995, a German Judge acquitted two men, both members of the right-wing Freiheitliche Arbeiter Partei (FAP, Free Worker’s Party), of charges stemming from their recording of a message that criticized the film, “Schindler’s List,” as “perpetuating the Auschwitz myth” on an established Neo-Nazi phone line. The judge based his decision on the defense’s successful arguments over the ambiguity of the word “myth.” This ruling followed soon after another high-profile German court decision involving a Holocaust denier involved in a separate incident. The two rulings brought to the forefront long-standing public distrust of the courts’ dealing with Holocaust denial and antisemitism cases. This distrust stemmed from the return of Nazi judges to their posts in the German civil service during the postwar years, and accusations that judges were lenient on right-wing extremists while being harsh in cases against the left. These cases came at a time of intense moral concern over Holocaust denial. The decisions created public scandals, which precipitated intense debates over the judges’ personal and professional backgrounds, as well as the rulings and opinions in the cases.
