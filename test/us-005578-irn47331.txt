The CKŻP provided care and assistance to Jews who survived the Holocaust. It legally represented all CKŻP-registered Polish Jews in their dealings with the new government and its agencies. It existed until 1950 when, together with the Jewish Cultural Society, representatives of CKŻP founded the Socio-Cultural Association of Jews in Poland [Source: Wikipedia] The Centralny Komitet Żydów w Polsce, CKŻP (Central Committee of Jews in Poland) was the most prominent official Jewish institution in Poland following the Holocaust.
