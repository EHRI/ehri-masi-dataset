Dr. Edgar Haas, a Jewish lawyer, was born on August 16, 1877 in Wiesbaden. In the 1930s he jointed a law practice with Dr. Wallter Klaas and Ernst Kaufmann. In December 1939, his provisional admission as a legal consultant was not renewed. From February 1939 he worked as an assistant to Herbert Samson. After his emigration to the Netherlands (from where Dr. Samson was later deported and murdered), he took over in 1939 the practice in the Great Theater Street 34th. About his fate nothing could be determined.
