Solomon Klug was born on July 9, 1923, in Krzepice, Poland. He grew up in a religious family with one sister and three brothers. Solomon’s mother and brother were shot in his backyard, and his father and other two brothers died in a camp. In 1940, he was taken to Annaberg, Germany, where he worked building the Autobahn. In 1943, he was taken to Markstädt (now Jelcz-Laskowice), Poland, where he built bridges. On March 23, 1944, he was taken to Fünfteichen, a subcamp of GrossRosen in Germany, then Politz, Czechoslovakia, (now Police, Ukraine) and then to Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp in Germany. From there, Solomon was transported to Barth, a sub-camp of Ravensbrück in Germany and was taken on a three-day death march after evacuation. Following his liberation on April 30, 1945, he went to Berlin, Germany, where he met his wife, Margaret. They immigrated to Israel and stayed for four years and then moved to Nuremberg, Germany, and spent a year in a displaced persons camp. In 1955, the Klugs came to the United States and settled in Atlanta.

The collection consists of four individual and family portraits of Solomon Klug's family. Included are Solomon, Hershel (brother), Nathan (brother), Jacob (father), Gittel (mother), Paula (sister), and Chaskel Klug (brother). Hershel and Nathan Klug were killed during World War II.
