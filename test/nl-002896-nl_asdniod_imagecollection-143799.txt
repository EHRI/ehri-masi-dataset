' Nazis Murder Jewish Slave Workers. At 7:30 A.M. April 22, 1945, a trainload of Jewish Hungarian slave laborers traveling to the rear of the shrinking German front lines was halted at Schwarzenfeld, 47 miles east of Nuremberg, Germany, by a U.S. plane. The plane did not hit the train but bombed the rails ahead of and behind it. The jews were taken off and shot in groups of 50 by Nazi guards. Their bodies were buried in a city dump and in some places were not even covered with earth, lime being thrown over them instead. The mass murders were discovered when units of the Third U.S. Army captured Schwarzenfeld at dusk April 23. The following morning, the American force rounded up local Nazi Party members and forced them to exhume the bodies and give them decent burial.
