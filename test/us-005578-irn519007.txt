1

Consists of one memoir, 13 pages, written by Cass Lewart, originally of Łódź, Poland. Mr. Lewart describes his family and life before the war, his memories of the German invasion, during which the family briefly fled to Warsaw before returning to Łódź. After witnessing the German occupation of Łódź, Mr. Lewart's father decided to move the family back to Warsaw, and managed to obtain false Aryan papers for them. The family lived outside the ghetto until they were denounced in the fall of 1942, and briefly imprisoned. Mr. Lewart and his mother were released and established a new false identity; his father managed to escape the ghetto and join them, but passed away soon after from illness. Mr. Lewart and his mother were separated and reunited several times, as Mr. Lewart went in and out of hiding, finally escaping Warsaw after the 1944 Warsaw uprising and reuniting with his mother in Milanowek, Poland.
