Correspondence mainly regarding the planning and erecting of a memorial for the unknown Jewish martyr in Paris (1951-1956). In addition, there are several CDJC queries for published and unpublished material, including queries for documents about Adolf Eichmann, or life and resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto. The latter is planned to be subject of an exhibition.

The correspondence contains two leaflets, an outline of the planned martyr memorial, two information sheets related to the CDJC publication ‘Ten years after Hitler’s Fall’, and a note on the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone of the martyr memorial.
