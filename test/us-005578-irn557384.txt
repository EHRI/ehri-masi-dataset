From 1927 he was active in various other aspects of the Zionist Movement. At the end of 1927 he became active in the Czechoslovakian Zionist Organization.

With the outbreak of the Second World War he remained in Geneva and was active in the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency until he immigrated to Palestine in 1946. Until 1940, he was active mainly in the promoting of immigration from Bohemia-Moravia and Slovakia to Palestine, and with issues of illegal immigration. Thereafter he dealt mainly with matters of aid to Jews under Nazi rule, the sending of food parcels to Jews in occupied Europe, including Bohemia and Moravia, the locating of family members, the providing of aid to refugees who had arrived in Switzerland, the running of Keren Hayesod in Switzerland, and with Zionist-cultural affairs there.
