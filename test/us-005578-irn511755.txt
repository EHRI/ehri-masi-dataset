Rose Zar (Szoszana Zarnowiecki or Rose Guterman) was born on July 27, 1923 in Piotrkoﾌ『 Trybunalski, Poland. After the German invasion, Rose lived in the Piotrkoﾌ『 ghetto until April 1940 when she fled to Warsaw where she obtained false identification papers under the name of Wanda Gajda. In December 1942 she moved to Krakoﾌ『 where she worked as a nanny in the home of Kurt Albers, a German SS officer. After the end of World War II, she married a fellow survivor, Mayer Zarnowiecki (Zar), who was interned in Buchenwald and Theresienstadt after leaving the Piotrkoﾌ『 ghetto. As displaced persons, the couple worked together at the Lindenfels children's home in Germany where they helped prepare Jewish children for emigration to Palestine.
