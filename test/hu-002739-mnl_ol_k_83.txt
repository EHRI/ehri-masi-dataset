The evolving relations between Nazi Germany and Hungary were one of the most central factors in the implementation of the Holocaust in Hungary. The records of the Hungarian Embassy in Berlin are of crucial importance since they convey information on the Holocaust and a sense of the differences and negotiation between the two states with the Hungarian Ambassador being an important agent in his own right. The documents are of special significance also since Regent Miklós Horthy appointed former Hungarian Ambassador Döme Sztójay as Prime Minister of Hungary in 1944 once Nazi Germany entered Hungary and thus the main phase of the Holocaust in Hungary was implemented under his government. The collection includes political reports, internal notes, cases of German-Italian arbitration as well as copies of ambassadorial reports and letters of Döme Sztójay that were mostly sent to Prime Minister Miklós Kállay and to Foreign Minister Imre Csáky. The collection of documents of the Hungarian Embassy in Berlin contains much that is of relevance for the study of the "Jewish question" in the period of Nazism and the history of the Holocaust. There are documents on imprisonment, internment and deportation. The collection also contains miscellaneous cases from 1944 such as requests of exempted Jews to return to Hungary.
