This collection consists of 164 letters written by Janina Halperson (later Ludawska) from 1939-1942, and various family photographs. The Halperson family lived in Warsaw; Janina left for Stockholm in August 1939 for a language course and stayed there until the end of the war. Her family was in the Warsaw ghetto during that time. Her parents, brother and his wife and distant relatives wrote post cards and letters to her and sent photos. Part of the photographs Janina Halperson took with her in 1939; another part was sent in the letters or she regained them after the war. The first letter was written in Aug. 7,1939, the last in July 19,1942. Includes also memoirs written by Janina Ludawska in 2000.
