Lt. Col. Ralph Willey collection

folder

1

Consists of 25 photographs from the collection of Lt. Col. Ralph E. Willey, a division Signal Corps officer for the 104th (Timberwolves) Division. Includes photographs of the liberation of Nordhausen and of the survivors and victims found by the 104th upon liberation. As Lt. Col Willey was a Signal Corps officer, he may have taken these photographs. Also includes a copy of a newspaper article entitled "Horror Conditions in Concentration Camps Told By Lt. Col. Willey, Who Saw Them," which references a letter he sent home after witnessing the liberation of Nordhausen, and a short memoir entitled "I Was Arrested by the Russians" regarding his May 1945 trip to the Russian zone, where he was interrogated by the Russian Army who were suspicious of his motives for being in Berlin.
