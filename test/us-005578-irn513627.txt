Beatrice Rada and Erika Eckstut were born in 1924 and 1928 in Znojmo, Czechoslovakia, to Ephraim Neuman and Dora (Dolly) Neuman (nee Geller). The family moved to Stanestie, Romania (Nyzhni Stanivtsi, Ukraine) in 1930, and Ephraim Neuman became mayor. Following a massacre of Jewish residents in 1941, the family fled to Chernivt︠s︡i where they were forced into the ghetto. Erika and Beatrice obtained false papers to escape the ghetto and fled to Kiev in 1943, where Erika worked in a clinic. Near the end of the war, a nurse mistook Beatrice for a German and informed on her to the NKVD, so the sisters decided to move to Czechoslovakia. Ephraim and Dora Neuman survived the war in Bucharest, but Ephraim died of natural causes shortly after liberation. Erika immigrated to the United States in 1960.

The Neuman family papers consist of photographs of Erika and Beatrice Neuman, their family, and classmates; a list of victims from Nyzhni Stanivtsi, Ukraine (Stanestie, Romania); letters from Ephraim Neuman to Max Neuman about a massacre in Nyzhni Stanivtsi, Ukraine and about the Chernivt︠s︡i ghetto; Chernivt︠s︡i ghetto identification cards for Beatrice and Erika Neuman; and clippings about Erika's reunion with her mother in America in 1960.
