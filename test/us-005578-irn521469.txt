Deutscher Kleinempfänger [German small radio] manufactured by G. Schaub in 1938. The radio was produced to help spread Nazi propaganda. It was made to sell at a low cost, so the majority of people could afford it. It lacked shortwave reception to make it difficult to receive foreign broadcasts. The radio was nicknamed Goebbels’ Schnauze [Snout], referring to the Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, who often addressed the public through radio.
