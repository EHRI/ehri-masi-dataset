Robert Treuer was born in Vienna, Austria in 1926, to Friedrich (Fritz) Treuer (1894-1967) and Maria (Marie or Mia) Weil Treuer (1897-1990). Fritz Treuer owned a stationery store and was part of the anti-fascist movement in Vienna, helping to smuggle underground newspapers into the country through Czechoslovakia. Marie Treuer was a music teacher. She and her son left Austria for England in August 1938, and her husband joined them a few months later. The family immigrated to the United States in 1939 and settled in Ohio.

The Robert Treuer family papers consist of emigration and immigration records, identification papers, memoirs, and subject files documenting the Treuer family’s life in Vienna, their escape to England and Ireland following the Anschluss, and their immigration to the United States. Emigration and immigration records include documents demonstrating that the Treuers had paid the requisite taxes and fees permitting them to leave Austria, letters of recommendations for Fritz and Marie Treuer, correspondence regarding affidavits and other requirements for American immigration, and a copy of the Treuers’ letter to friends celebrating their American naturalization. Identification papers consist of a Certificate of Registration from the United Kingdom, two police certificates of good standing from the Mexican Consulate in Vienna, a certificate of identity in lieu of passport, and a German Reich passport for Fritz and Marie Treuer. Robert Treuer’s memoir describes his flight from Nazi‐annexed Austria, his stays in a boarding school and Basque children’s home in England and at the Newtown boarding school in Ireland, his family’s immigration to the United States, his life in Ohio, and his careers in labor organization, Indian community organization, and government service. Fritz Treuer’s memoir describes his grandfather’s childhood in Ungarisch Ostra (now Uherský Ostroh, Czech Republic), his own upbringing in Vienna, and his intellectual, cultural, and political interests. Subject files include Fritz Treuer’s secondhand account of how Austrian partisans foiled a Nazi plan to destroy art hidden in abandoned salt mines near Bad Aussee, a letter and pamphlet documenting Claire and Karl Bliss (Blitz) and their experiences in Dachau and Shanghai, a report about the Austrian Fund on behalf of needy people in Austria, and correspondence documenting the Treuers’ efforts to locate their relatives after the war.
