Liberation of Minsk

The Soviet regular army meets up with Jewish or Roma partisans (they are not identified as such in the narration). One of the partisans wears a bullet clip around his shoulders. A female partisan, wearing a patterned head scarf, smiles at the camera. Scenes from the liberation of Minsk on July 3, 1944. A sign in German reads, "End of the Autobahn Minsk." A cameraman films the activity. Shot of the ghetto burning. A Soviet tank rolls down the street. German POWs with their hands raised in surrender. Soldiers greet smiling townspeople. A swastika falls off a building. A Soviet soldier cuts a German flag down from a building and replaces it with a Soviet flag. Cheering townspeople with added sound.
