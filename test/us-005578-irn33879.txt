United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Gabryela Bromberg was born on August 27, 1938 in Lublin, Poland. She was the only daughter of Rachela Epsztajn Bromberg and Michał Bromberg. In 1939 the Bromberg family moved to Zamość, Poland. During the liquidation of the Zamość ghetto, the Jewish population was forced into transit camp in Izbica. At that time Gabryela’s parents were already deported to Sobibór concentration camp, where they both perished. Gabryela was pushed out of the marching column by an unknown woman. She was wounded by the shots of the German guards. She does not remember how she arrived at Mrs. Regina Jabłońska’s house in Izbica. Gabryela was hidden by Regina Jabłońska for two years, allowing her to get out of the hiding place for two hours every day. After the liberation in July 1944, Mrs. Jabłońska started to search for Gabryela’s relatives. She located Adam Bromberg, Gabryela’s paternal uncle and demanded a payment allegedly promissed to her by Gabryela’s father. At the same time Mrs. Jabłońska approached JOINT and demanded a payment as well. In 1946 Gabryela was finally transferred to her uncle, but in 1948 he placed her in a Jewish children’s home in Sródborów and later in Kraków. In 1954 Adam Bromberg adopted Gabryela. She lived in Warsaw until 1978, at which time she immigrated to Sweden.

The Gabryela Bromberg collection consists of seven pre-war family photographs of the Bromberg family in Lublin, Poland and Berlin, Germany, and the testimony of Regina Jabłońska who hid Gabryela Bromberg from October 1942 until their liberation in July 1944.
