This file contains a letter from 13th June 1935. It is written in German and addressed to a certain Doctor Weil living in Madrid. The signature at the end of the letter is to illegible. The letter focuses on the rising antisemitism in Spain due to the massive Nazi propaganda and the publishing of the Protocols in Spanish newspapers. The Bern trials are not mentioned in the media. One of the biggest newspapers in Spain, the ABC, will publish more antisemitic books. The author of the letter tried desperately to stop the publishing but didn't succeed. Now he's seeking material and asks his friend and the Jewish community for help so that he has enough proof for his planned article-series. In this series he will try to prove the falsification of the Protocols, hoping to put an end to the rising antisemitism.
