Paul Blank (1923-2011, some records place his birth on 2 July 1925) was born Pajasch Blank on 2 July 1923 in Bełżyce, Poland to Berek Blank and Gita Feld. He had two sisters and two brothers. After the German invasion of Poland he was likely in the Bełżyce and Bedzin ghettos. He was deported to the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp, and sent to the Flossenbürg concentration camp on 4 August 1944. He was transferred to the Dachau concentration camp on 5 April 1945 and liberated in May while on a death march. After liberation, he was in the Zeilsheim displaced persons camp until he immigrated to the United States in 1946 aboard the SS Marine Perch.

The collection consists of post-war photographs depicting Holocaust survivor Paul Blank standing with fellow survivors and American soldiers in front of the memorial monument at the Zeilsheim displaced persons camp in Zeilsheim, Germany.
