Notes de Mgr Tardini

Unavailable.

Tardini reports that the Brazilian ambassador said that:
- non-Aryan immigrants give an awful impression to people in Brasil;
- many non-Aryan immigrants were baptised in 1939.
Therefore:
- Non-Aryans will be granted a visa only if they were baptised some years earlier;
- exceptions to this rule have to be very rare.
