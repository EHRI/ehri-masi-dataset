Consists of one memoir, 30 pages, "Peter's Story: Surviving Auschwitz and a Death March," by Dr. Peter Ornstein, originally of Vienna, Austria. In his memoir, he describes wartime Vienna, being entrusted to neighbors as his mother and future stepfather had immigrated to China (with the intention that Peter and his two sisters would follow), and in 1939, to a convent when it became too dangerous. In 1942, they were relocated to a building used to collect potential deportees, but were released because their paternity (and thus degree of Jewishness) was questioned. In February 1944, Peter was arrested and deported to Auschwitz. He describes his life in Auschwitz, his work in a nearby labor camp, and his memories of the Sonderkommando uprising. He describes his death march from Auschwitz in great detail, as he was able to feign death and escape from the march. Peter was liberated by the Red Army near Gleiwitz (Gliwice, Poland). After the war ended, he returned to Vienna on foot and was reunited with his sisters, both of whom also survived Auschwitz. Also includes an appendix that includes important events in Dr. Ornstein's life.
