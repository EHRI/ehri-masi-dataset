Although the "Banque de Salonique" was sold to a Turkish bank, the latter neglected the archives of the bank's branch in Thessaloniki. The archives were delivered to thw National Bank of Greece by the company responsible for the safekeeping, with the mediation of Mr. Evangelos Hekimoglou.

The "Banque de Salonique" was established by the Allatini family in 1888. Apart from its involvement in banking the Allatini family was also active in mining, tobacco (growing, processing and trading), the silk industry, wheat trade, roller mills, ceramic manufacturing and brewing. "Landerbank" also participated in the share capital of the "Banque de Salonique". In 1909, the bank was taken over by French business interests and the head office was transferred to Constantinople (Istanbul). The bank established branches in Athens, Piraeus, and Kavala. The Kavala branch closed in 1934, and the Thessaloniki branch ceased operations in 1940.

The "Banque de Salonique" archive consists of records of current accounts, securities, cashier records and customer records, journals, ledgers and files of incoming correspondence, letters of guarantee, cashier and other vouchers.
