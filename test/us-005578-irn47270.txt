Allan Leon Dreyfuss (1919-2011) was born in Brookline, MA to Alice Schwab and Charles Dreyfuss. He attended Brookline High School and earned a Bachelor’s degree at the University of Chicago. Allan enlisted in the Army Air Corps at the beginning of WWII and began a career in journalism as a reporter for Stars and Stripes, the armed forces newspaper. In 1945 he was assigned to cover the trials in Nuremberg, Germany. Between the close of trial testimony and the Tribunal's judgment Allan wrote a summary of charges against the 21 main defendants, later published as “These 21.” Allan married Cecilia (d. 2001) and had four children: Anne Elisabeth (known as AE), Peter, Stephen, and Jonathan.

Contains a booklet entitled "These 21," written by Allan Dreyfuss and published by Stars and Stripes, based on Dreyfuss's assigned coverage of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in December 1945. Each of the 21 Nazi defendants' positions within the Third Reich is detailed as well as the crimes of which they are accused. The defendant’s original signatures are taped in the booklet in the chapter in which they are included by Frank Elkins, a United States military police officer who worked at the IMT. Also included are two handwritten notes, from defendants Fritz Sauckel and Hans Fritsche, requesting to meet with other defendants as well as a letter addressed to Elkins in Germany, January 1947, from Kurt Schindler, a locksmith in Nuremberg, bartering his services for 10 packs of cigarettes.
