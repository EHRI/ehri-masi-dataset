Inow family: copy correspondence

1 folder

This collection consists of correspondence between Renate Inow, in England, her sister, Margalit in Sweden and Palestine and their parents in Wuppertal, Germany. The collection comprises 2 parts: an unbound volume of translations and partial translations of letters addressed to Margalit mostly whilst she was in Sweden entitled 'Voices from the Past'. This collection includes reproductions of photographs of the parents and a family tree. Margalit provides the following information in the introduction. She began collecting letters from her parents after Kristallnacht, and, after May 1939, from her sister, Renate, in England. Her grandmother's letters to the family in the USA are also included. In addition there is a separate set of photocopied correspondence mostly from the Inow parents in Wuppertal, but also other relatives, to Renate in London, dated May-August 1939. Margalit remarks that the letters were, of course, censored and characterises them thus: "they are a historical document reflecting the terrible times German Jews had to endure during the Nazi era. The letters also convey my parents' courage to cope and the fortitude that enabled them, in spite of hardships and constant worry, to find solace and beauty in nature and to enjoy music and reading. As far as I know they never succumbed to despair." The parents, Max and Beatrice, perished in the Lodz Ghetto in 1942. Later accrual consists of Alfred Inow's Pioneer Corp and Internment Camp papers. Alfred Inow, born 5 April 1922, was the brother of Renate. Material accessioned 10.,6.2013
