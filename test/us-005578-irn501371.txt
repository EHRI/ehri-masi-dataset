"My Mother's Diary"

folder

1

Consists of a copy of a typed English translation of the diary of Ella Pick, originally of Vienna, which she began in 1920 to document the life of her son, Rudi (Rudolph) Pick, who later edited the diary. In the diary, Ella describes Rudi's health and schooling throughout his childhood, addressing him directly after Rudi managed to escape to England. At the end of the diary, she tells him that his parents are soon to depart and writes of how proud they are their son. Also includes a conclusion in which Rudolph writes of his own wartime history and of finding out of his parents' deportation and deaths. The Picks were deported to Theresienstadt (Terezin) and later to Auschwitz, where they perished.
