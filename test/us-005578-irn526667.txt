Documents, correspondence and photographs illustrating the experiences of Max and Lucia Levy and their children George and Ursula Levy, from Lippstadt, Germany. Max, a World War I veteran was arrested in 1938 with his brother Ludwig and sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp; they both perished as a result of their imprisonment. Lucia sent her children in 1939 to Holland where they were taken in by Joseph and Agnes van Mackelenbergh and then in St. Jacob's convent in Eersal, Holland. George and Ursula were denounced and deported to Vught and Westerbork concentration camps and then to Bergen Belsen concentration camp in February 1944, where they were imprisoned until April 10, 1945. The Germans then loaded the children along with 700 other prisoners on to a transport that kept changing routes to avoid Allied bombings and was finally liberated by the Russians in Troebitz, Germany on April 23, 1945. George and Ursula were reunited with the Van Mackelenburghs. Lucia perished in Stutthof concentration camp in August 1944. The children immigrated to Chicago in 1947 to live with their maternal aunt and uncle, the Muellers.
