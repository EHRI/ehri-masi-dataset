Collection of testimonies (written statements, in newsletters, and correspondence) from multiple American soldiers who were captured as Prisoners of War by the Germans during WWII and first sent to Stalag IXB in Bad Orb, Germany and then selected as part of a group of 350 American POWs who were sent to do forced labor at Berga, a sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp. Includes a document by Diane Kessler outlining her research process to identify soldiers sent to Berga who were members of the US Armyâ€™s 70th Infantry Division.
