Herta Ningo: family papers

3 folders

Nothing is known about the provenance of this collection of family papers relating to Herta Ningo. Nor are the relationships between individuals represented always that clear.

Herta Ningo, a German Jew from Berlin arrived in Great Britain shortly after 11 July 1939- the date she left Hamburg according to her passport. She was the daughter of Max Ningo a businessman who died in 1930, and Meta n√©e Rewald, who, according to the memorial book for Berlin Jews who died during the Holocaust, committed suicide on 15 January 1942. The only correspondence between mother and daughter is a Red Cross telegram in which Meta responds on 12 January 1941. Many of the papers concern the Rewald family, in particular Arthur Rewald, who, it is assumed, was the brother of Meta Ningo, Herta's mother. Arthur Rewald married Elsa Salzmann in 1933. Of particular interest is a certificate recording Arthur Rewald's official resignation from the Jewish faith, dated 13 December 1913, and a subsequent note from the board of the Jewish community, Berlin, stating that he had to continue paying his dues until the end of 1914. It is worth noting that in the eyes of the nazis he was still considered Jewish- a tax form dated 1938 includes the Jewish form 'Israel' in his name. In addition there are some post-war papers dealing with the issue of restitution. Many of them refer to the family Heilmann, whose relationship to Rewald or Ningo is unclear.
