Henni Lesley: copy family documents

1 folder

Little is known about the subject of this collection, save that which can be gleaned from the papers themselves. It appears that Henni Lesley, formerly Lewin, formerly a Jewish resident of Berlin, was at one time imprisoned at Lichtenburg Concentration Camp (1541/1); that she probably emigrated to Great Britain shortly after her release(circa 1938/9); and that her parents were deported East in March 1943, never to be seen again (1541/4).
