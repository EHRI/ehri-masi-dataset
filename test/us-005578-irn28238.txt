Unfortunately not much is known about Friedrich Melchior, other than that he provided the designs for this pamphlet, and lived on Yuen Ming Yuen road in Shanghai, China.

Consists of one pamphlet entitled "Good-bye Mr. Ghoya," published in Shanghai in September 1945. The pamphlet was a denunciation of Sgt. Kano Ghoya, the Japanese ex-vice chief of the Stateless Refugees' Affairs Bureau in Shanghai, and includes seven cartoons by Friedrich Melchior. Ghoya adminsitered the Hongkou (Hongkew) district of Shanghai. During World War II, 20,000 Jewish refugees traveled to live in the Hongkou district, which became known as the Shanghai ghetto. The pamphlet ridicules Mr. Ghoya, labeling him "The King of the Jews" and mocks his cruelty.
