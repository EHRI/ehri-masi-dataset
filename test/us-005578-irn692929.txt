The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

Argentine one-sheet poster, printed in 1946, for the American feature film “Address Unknown,” originally released in the United States on June 1, 1944. The film was based on the 1938 novella of the same name in “Story” magazine by Kressmann Taylor (penname for Katherine Taylor), and it was nominated for the Academy Awards for Art Direction and Music in 1944. The film tells the story of two German business partners in the United States, whose friendship and families are destroyed when one of them returns to Germany, and succumbs to the Nazi regime and its propaganda. When the businessman in Germany turns his back on the woman who is both his Jewish partner’s daughter and his own son’s fiancée, leading to her death, he begins receiving a series of incriminating letters from the U.S. The original novella became so popular that a shortened version of it was reprinted in “Reader’s Digest” in 1939, printed in hardcover in 1940, and was reissued in the late 20th century as an international bestseller. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
