Mr. Landman reconstructed by memory his childhood diary, which relates his life in German-occupied eastern Poland between 1941-1945 (25 pages). The other memoir is of Mrs. Pepe Landman, mother of Alejandro, written from Montevideo in 1986-1987, relating the Holocaust experiences of herself and her family (67 pages). The family moved from Stanislawow to Lwow in 1941 and lived there until 1943, when they went into hiding in Buczacz. After the war, they emigrated to Uruguay. Collection also contains copies of post-war school records of Aleksander Landman in Poland (1946-1947), documents related to his family's immigration to Uruguay in 1948, and photographs he took on a trip to Stanislawow (Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine) in 1999.
