The collection contains records related to the Jewish settlement in Lower Silesia after 1945. Consists of the surviving office files of the Provincial Committee, which was established in June 1945 and liquidated in 1949. Includes protocols, reports (description and statistics) of the Provincial Committee, as well as of the municipal and county committees, numerous name indexes from the Department of Evidencing and Statistics and the lists of the Department of Child Care. Unfortunately, the documents of the Departments of Youth, Culture and Propaganda and Emigration were scrapped almost in total. It makes the studies on some crucial issues of Jewish settlement in Lower Silesia after 1945 impossible to conduct. Almost all prints (apart from one copy of the Bulletin of the Central Committee of the Polish Jews) were disposed of, too. Only half part of the collection finally survived.
