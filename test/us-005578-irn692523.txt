Irene (Irén) Reiner (née Mondschein) was born in Debrecen, Hungary on 17 May 1920 to Regina (née Deszberg) and Jeno Mondschein. She completed high school in the Lyceum for Girls of the Jewish Community in Debrecen between the years of 1927 and 1939. Irene worked as a registered nurse and eventually married obstetrician and gynecologist Martin (Márton) Reiner M.D. (b. 5 February 1910). Together, they had a son, Robert Reiner. Materials in the collection indicate that they were forced to use false identification papers and go underground after 1944. Eventually, she immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1949.

The Irene Reiner collection illustrates the experiences of Irén (Irene) Mondschein Reiner surrounding the war. It includes her passport, original photographs, identification cards, translated correspondence, and original certificates. A hardcover Hungarian passport issued to Irén Reiner in 1946 also includes the name of her son, Robert. A stamped Jewish identification card with an original portrait photo of Irene, issued in 1944, indicates that as a registered nurse, the holder must wear a yellow star and can travel between a set number of hours during the day in Budapest. Documents relating to her naturalization include a compiled school certificate from 1948 that summarizes her education between the years of 1927 and 1939, a marriage certificate between Irene and her husband, Dr. Márton Reiner, and her original U.S. Naturalization Certificate signed “Irene Reiner” and dated 19 May 1949. In addition, translated documents from the Free Professional Union of Hungarian Physicians all dated in 1946 bear stapled, type-written notes from Dr. Márton (Martin) Reiner, indicating that he was not involved in fascist activities as an obstetrician and gynecologist and spent time working at the Elisabeth Sanatorium in Budakeszi before Hungary’s liberation in 1945.
