Joel Beer, his brother, Daniel, and their mother, Henriette, survived World War II in hiding in the villages of Saint-Amour and Balanod, France. His father, Edgar, was arrested by the Gestapo in 1942 and kept in solitary confinement for four months. He was then transferred to two other cities and eventually deported to Buchenwald concentration camp and then the Allach concentration camp where he was liberated on May 31, 1945.

The collection consists of 32 photographs relating to Joe Beyersdorf (Joel Beer) and his experiences in hiding with his brother, Daniel, his parents, and his grandmother in France during World War II, including his activities with a Yeshurun youth group in Lyon, France.
