boxes

2

Consists of papers related to the Holocaust experiences of Ruth Salmon Seltzer, originally of Lambsheim, Germany. Ruth was sent on a Kindertransport from Germany to France in 1939, and lived in the OSE home of La Guette, before being sent to the United States in 1941. Her mother and sisters spent part of the war in the Rivesaltes and Gurs concentration camps, and emigrated to the United States after the war. The collection includes wartime paperwork, identity cards, and restitution documentation, including correspondence regarding the decision to legally declare the deaths of Ruth's older brothers, one of whom died as a member of the French resistance, the other of whom was deported to Łódź and presumably perished. Also includes immediate post-war correspondence between Ruth in the United States and her mother and sisters in France, as well as OSE reunion information and a copy of Heinz (Henry) Löw's diary written as a child in various OSE homes.
