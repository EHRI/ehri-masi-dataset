<p>Peter Kien was born in January 1919 in Warnsdorf, Czechoslovakia, the son of a textile manufacturer, whose business collapsed during the economic crisis of 1929. He began painting whilst a student at the German Realschule in Brünn and continued his schooling in art at the Prague Academy where he studied under Willi Nowak. The situation in Czechoslovakia got steadily worse particularly for Jews after the annexation of Austria in March 1938. During this time he met Ilse Stransky. They married in September 1940. In December 1941 he was deported to Theresienstadt.<br /></p><p>In Theresienstadt he met many more artists and writers whilst working in the graphics department. He became increasingly active as a portrait artist and sketcher of fellow inmates. Above all he immersed himself in the theatrical and musical life of the camp.<br /><br />In July 1942 he was joined by his wife and January 1943, his parents. He wrote poetry and several plays and his libretto for the opera <em>Der Kaiser von Atlantis oder der Tod dankt ab</em> which had its premiere in Amsterdam in 1975.<br /><br />He was sent to Auschwitz on the last transport in October 1944 along with his wife and parents where he was murdered.</p>
