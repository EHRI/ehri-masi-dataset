Street scenes; ghetto inhabitants

VAR pedestrian street scene, nicely-dressed crowd walking by shop fronts. Two men converse, smilingly, in doorway. Street vendors and beggars at crowded doorway. Beside, poor children huddled and lying on sidewalk, a man sells hats from chair. Woman and crying child. Woman begs on street, a man laying beside them. All face camera: young boys hop on a tram, smiling; two shots, man in rags then woman in rags on street. Camera follows well-dressed couple across street, then along crowded sidewalk. Brief CU of girl. Well dressed woman by poor one. Shots of very poor children on street. Boy, ragged and hobbling badly, using a cane, walks toward camera; then two young girls.
