Hermann Zutraun (1906-1997) was born on 1906 July 22 in Osterode, Germany to Samuel Zutraun and Laura Grünberg. He had one sister, Blanka Mosel. Hermann married to Alice Murzynski (b. 1903 in Danzig) in March 1934, and they had one daughter, Renate (b. 1934 in Istanbul). In May 1933 Hermann was arrested in Danzig and deported to the Neusustrum and Lichtenberg concentration camps in Germany. He was released in December 1939, and decided to immigrate to Istanbul, Turkey in March 1934, where one of his friends was living. Hermann found employment with the German firm Hochtief A.G. He was fired from his job in April 1939. He moved to Ankara in 1940 and survived the war there. Hermann and his family immigrated to the United States in 1949 and settled in San Francisco, California.

The collection documents the wartime experiences of Hermann Zutraum and his family, who survived the Holocaust in Ankara, Turkey. Included is a Red Cross inquiry from Hilde Strassburger to Martha Pick, Hermann’s wife Alice Murzynski’s aunt; a postcard sent to Martin Gabrielski in Berlin, Germany, from Hermann Zutraun in Ankara; and an envelope sent to Hermann’s aunt Else Zutraun in Berlin from Ankara.
