Sidney Stenzler (1910-2004) was born in New York to Charles and Sarah Stenzler. He served with the 915th Signal Corps during World War II, was stationed at Landsberg at the end of the war, and volunteered his free time to assist Displaced Persons, for example by publicizing their plight and by collecting clothing and personal items from departing GIs.

The Sidney Stenzler papers consist of correspondence documenting the situation of Displaced Persons at Landsberg in 1945, photographs of Dachau and Buchenwald, and writings and speeches describing the Warsaw Ghetto, the plight of DPs, and the deaths of Italian Holocaust victims. Correspondence primarily consists of V‐Mail and letters from Stenzler to his wife describing his activities with DPs in Landsberg and his trip to Dachau. This series also includes a letter from his friend’s wife, Barbara Falik, including excerpts of letters in which her husband, Sidney Falik, described his activities with DPs in Landsberg. Photographs depict structures, corpses, crematoria from Dachau and Buchenwald as well as a concert at Dachau attended by German prisoners of war and were given to Stenzler by Holocaust survivors. Writings and speeches include an unattributed Polish narrative about the Warsaw Ghetto, a victory speech about the plight of DPs at Landsberg by J. Olejski, and a memorial speech about Italian Holocaust victims by Dr. Edmons.
