Okru≈æna uprava narodnih dobara Tuzla

13 boxes

The fond contains dossiers with information about property of all types (mostly movable goods) that was either confiscated from enemies (German nationals and other enemies of the state after World War 2) or restored to their original owners that lost it during Ustasha regime of the Independent State of Croatia (Serbs and Jews in most cases).
Each dossier carries a name of individual (or several of them) whose property was confiscated, restored, or was involved in the work of the Office in some way.

Often included are documents noting public auctions of goods (clothes, furniture, etc.) that belonged to arrested Jews and were sold to local peddlers (in these cases names of the peddlers were part of the dossiers) or given away to hospitals, schools or individuals loyal to the Ustasha regime.
