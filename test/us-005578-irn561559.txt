Janina Irena Fronc (1927-2007) was born Sztrumpf on November 22, 1927 in Kraków to automotive engineer Władysław Sztrumpf and teacher Bella Celina Sztrumpf (nee Wajsberg, 1896-1995). She had a Catholic half-brother who was also named Władysław Sztrumpf. When World War II started, the family moved to Tarnopol (Ternopil, Ukraine) and then crossed into Romania on September 17, 1939, where they survived the Holocaust in Băile Govora, Slatina, and Craiova. Many of Janina’s high school classmates were killed on the MV Struma on the way to Palestine in 1942, and Bella Celina’s parents were shot in the Ternopil ghetto in 1943. Janina’s family returned to Poland in 1945, and her father died in Łódź, Poland. In Warsaw in April 1948, she married Wiktor Grajewski (born Szpilman, 1925-2007), who had survived the war in performing labor in Nuzhyary (Siberia), Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The couple had daughter Anna in 1949 and moved to Israel in 1957. Janina and Anna immigrated to the United States in 1964, and Janina worked as a draftsperson for engineering companies and mapmakers. Janina remarried twice (Ignacy Musiol and Bolesław Fronc).
