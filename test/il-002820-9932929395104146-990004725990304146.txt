This file contains a report of the German Embassy of Rome to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin dated 17.11.1933 regarding Propaganda, in a general sense and especially French, Polish and Czech Propaganda, as well as Austrian Influences and German defensive measures against Anti-German Propaganda. The "Holy See" itself does everything to upkeep absolute neutrality since hte end of the last war and strives for peace within Europe and the whole world. There is no Anti-German Propaganda from this side, neither in the press, nor in radio broadcasting. The only newspaper of Vatican City, the "Observatore Romano", is headed by its main editor Conte Dalla Torre, who has been working together closely for a long time with the French Embassy. He also is Anti Fascist and takes a strong stand against National Socialism. French Propaganda within the Vatican is mainly promoted by the Clergy. The same can be said about Polish Propaganda. There are singular events of Anti-German Propaganda by the Czech, as well as a certain German-Austrian influence by one editor of the "Observatore Romano". Defensive measures regarding Anti-German Propaganda is a very important task and can be done by enlightening all the relevant positions of the Vatican and getting young German Clergymen into the Vatican to do this as well.
