Contains a letter and recommendations, dated October 1, 1938, written by Friedel Tykoschinski (b. September 26, 1914 in Trier, Germany) who moved in 1926 together with her parents Hersch Hermann (b. 1887) and Rosa (b. 1885), and younger brother Erwin to Berlin. She asked Mrs. Cohen (donor's mother) to send her a secondary affidavit, supporting that of Friedel's uncle in New York. Friedel and Erwin managed to reach safe haven in London, England, but their parents were deported from Berlin on October 24, 1941 to the Łódź ghetto where they both died.
