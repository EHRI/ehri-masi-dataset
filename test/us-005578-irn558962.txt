He was taken to Stalag IX-C in 1940 and was liberated by United States troops in 1945. Edwin eventually immigrated to the United States and had a daughter, Heather.

The collection includes a diary kept by Edwin Allan after he was captured during the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the French port of Dunkirk in 1940.
