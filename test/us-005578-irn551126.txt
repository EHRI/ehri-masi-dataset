Benjamin Buchsbaum (1888-1970) was born in New York City on 21 April 1888, the son of Sigmund and Regie (nee Tandlich) Buchsbaum, who had immigrated to the United States in 1883. The elder Buchsbaum subsequently started a real estate business in Philadelphia, which Benjamin joined at the age of 19, and continued to work in for the remainder of his career. As an adult, he was active in the Philadelphia Jewish community, and served as president of Congregation Adath Jeshurun for nine years, beginning in 1939. It was during this period that he sought to help many people, including relatives from Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Poland, escape from Nazi occupied Europe and immigrate to the United States. It has been determined that he provided affidavits for 36 people, of whom at least 23 were able to emigrate, and arrive in the United States or Great Britain between 1938-1941, and 1945-1946. Of those who sought to leave, 11 were unable and were subsequently murdered during the Holocaust, and the status of the remainder is unknown.

The collection primarily contains correspondence sent to and from Benjamin Buchsbaum, of Philadelphia, relating to his efforts to rescue relatives, friends, and strangers from Nazi-occupied Europe and bring them to the United States. Correspondence is often from those he sought to help, as well as others who recognized his efforts, and dates from the period of the Holocaust up through the 1960s. The album was presented to Buchsbaum by his family on the occasion of his 70th birthday in 1958, but he added letters to the album that he received from some of the correspondents in subsequent years as well. Also included are receipts of money orders he sent to family and friends; and two photographs of Benjamin, his daughter Jean, and son William. Also included is an additional album that was assembled as a tribute to the life and career of Buchsbaum. The album includes letters of tribute, correspondence, photographs, clippings, and articles authored by Buchsbaum.
