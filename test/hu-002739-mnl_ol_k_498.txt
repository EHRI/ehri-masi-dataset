The Holocaust was not only the largest genocidal operation in 20th century Hungarian history but also a gigantic campaign to systematically rob the wealth of Hungarian Jewry. In Hungary, the Europe-wide campaign of robbery usually referred to by the name of Aryanization had various initiators and a large segment of benefactors in society while it was also planned as a state-directed and -controlled process. In June 1944, a Government Commissioner’s Office for Solving the Material and Financial Affairs of the Jews was newly established. As of July 23, Albert Turvölgyi, who until then served as Head of Department at the Ministry of Finance and was an expert in Aryanization measures (he had been responsible for the Aryanization of the liquor industry in particular), was promoted to direct this newly established Office with its eleven departments. Amidst rivalry from various other ministries, local administrative offices and party organizations, the authority of the Commissioner’s Office did not match the encompassing plans for a supraministry of redistribution. The activities of the Office were launched with some months of delay towards the end of the summer 1944. Turvölgyi was dismissed after the Arrow Cross takeover and the Commission was eventually incorporated into the Arrow Cross Ministry of the Interior headed by Árpád Toldy.
