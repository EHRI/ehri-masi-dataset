Eugen Schwarz (1904-1966) was born in Czechoslovakia to Albert and Helene Schwarz. He married Gertrude Singer Schwarz (1911-1998), and the couple had twin daughters, Vera and Daisy, in 1936. Eugen Schwarz was a banker and was transferred to Paris in 1938. From there the family immigrated to the United States via Lisbon in 1941. Gertrude Schwarz’s mother, Hedwig Riesenfeld (1887-1942), was deported from Brünn to Theresienstadt in January 1942 and then two months later to Izbica where she was killed. Gertrude’s brother, Heinrich Singer, fled Czechoslovakia with his wife and is believed to have been killed in Lvov. Eugen Schwarz’s parents are believed to have been deported to concentration camps in Poland.
