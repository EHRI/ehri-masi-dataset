Le nonce à Bruxelles Micara au cardinal Maglione

Micara informs Maglione that the Brazilian Consul-General in Antwerp is the only person in Europe who is allowed to grant visas to Non-Aryans. Micara refused granting the required recommandation to Federico [Friederich] Tockus because his acts of baptism were forged. Tockus is the nephew of former German Chancellor Hermann Müller.
