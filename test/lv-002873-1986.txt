There is no proof evidence that Latvian SSR PCI / PCSS (Russian: NKVD/NKGB) archives existed during 1940–1941. When war between the USSR and Nazi Germany began, the criminal records created in the period 1940–1941 were evacuated to inner regions of the USSR (including records about people who had been apprehended in mass arrests and deported). After World War II, and mostly after 1956, a major part of the criminal records were sent from administration archives of the USSR Republics, regions and districts. Since 1947 CSS (Russian: KGB) criminal records were delivered to the archive from Investigation Office of Latvian SSR Ministry of State Security, regional Offices of Latvian SSR Committee for State Security, Office for Fight against Banditry of LSSR Ministry of Interior, Baltic Military District, USSR Military Districts, Railway Office and accorded structures of Latvian SSR Ministry of State Security. Information delivered to CSS (Russian: KGB) Archive included criminal records of people who had been politically judged; these records were delivered from various USSR War Tribunals, Special Council of the PCI (Russian: Osoboye Soveshchaniye pri NKVD), the counter- intelligence agency SMERSH and from various other courts and institutions of investigation. In subsequent years criminal records of politically judged were collected in Latvian SSR CSS (Russian: KGB) Archive; these records applied to territory of Latvian SSR and its residents, according to legislation of USSR. After termination of Latvian SSR CSS (Russian: KGB) in August 1991, the collection of Latvian SSR CSS criminal records were taken by the Office of the Prosecutor General. On May 31, 1996 the Office of the Prosecutor General delivered the Latvian SSR CSS (Russian: KGB) collection of criminal records to the State Archive of Latvia. On August 6, 1992 a part of the criminal records were transferred from Russia’s CSS (Russian: KGB) Archive of Ulyanovsk District to the State Archive of Latvia.

The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (LSSR) People’s Commissariat of State Security (PCSS; Russian: NKGB) was established on 31 March 1941 by the separation of the LSSR People’s Commissariat of Interior (PCI; Russian: NKVD). PCSS was a republic-wide institution accountable to the USSR’s NKGB; its main task was state security interests. During the period of Nazi Germany occupation of Latvia, the PCSS was evacuated and worked in the unoccupied USSR. On 24 March 1946 PCSS was reorganized as the LSSR Ministry of State Security (MSS). On 13 April 1953 the Latvian SSR MSS was united with the Latvian SSR Ministry of Interior (MI), and the Ministry of Interior ( MI) was established. On 10 April 1954 the Latvian SSR Committee for State Security (CSS; Russian: Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti (KGB)) was established, which was attached to the Latvian SSR Council of Ministers (CM). CSS was republic-wide institution accountable to the USSR. On 7 September 1978 the Latvian SSR CM CSS changed its name to the Latvian SSR CSS. The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic Committee for State Security was terminated according to the decision of the Republic of Latvia Supreme Council of 24 August 1991, “On the Termination of Activities of the USSR State security institutions in the Republic of Latvia”.
