Henry Landman was born Heinz Landmann in Augsburg, Germany, in 1920 to Josef Landmann (1895- 1964) and Regina (Recha) Landmann, née Grünebaum. After Kristallnacht, he and his father were arrested and imprisoned at Dachau. The family began arranging their immigration to America and managed to get transferred from the Polish quota to the Russian quota. Josef Landmann left Germany for the United States via England in early 1939. Regina Landmann sailed directly to the United States with her daughters, Johanna (Joan, 1922-1970) and Irma (1923-1985), in August, while Henry Landmann traveled to England in the spring of 1939 and joined his family in November 1939. In January 1943 he was inducted into the United States Army. He was initially assigned to Company B, 18th Battalion, 8th Replacement Depot in Oran but then joined the 3rd Infantry Division, 30th Infantry Regiment, 1st Battalion, landed in Europe at Anzio, fought in Italy, France, Germany, and Austria, and helped liberate his hometown of Augsburg on April 28, 1945. He returned to the United States at the end of September 1945 and lived in New York. Josef Landmann’s parents, Gerson and Sofie Landmann, sisters, Rosa Rodoff and Paula Frydman, and the Rodoff and Frydman families were killed during the Holocaust as were Regina Landmann’s sisters, Minna Wolf and Else Aretz, and the Aretz family.

This series also includes awards, programs, and clippings documenting Henry Landman’s participation in sports activities and military records documenting his active service in Europe and decorations he received during World War II. Also included are receipts for money orders sent to Henry and Josef Landman while they were imprisoned in Dachau in 1938, lists of Jewish residents of Augsburg deported to concentration camps, and lists of Henry Landman’s family members killed in concentration camps. Correspondence files primarily include the “V-mail” letters Henry and his parents exchanged between the United States, North Africa, and Europe during World War II.

German records document tax requirements, police registrations, and currency laws. American records document visa requirements, the Landmans’ transfer from the Polish visa quota to the Russian visa quota, and naturalization certificates for Henry’s parents.
