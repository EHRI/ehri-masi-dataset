Benvenuto Mario Vitta (Mario, 1906-1945) was born in Turin, Itally to Adolfo Vitta and Stella Segre. He lived in Milan, Italy with his wife Ines Jannone, their son Adolfo, and their daughters Luciana and Adriana. In November 1943 Mario learned that Jews would soon be rounded up. He sent his son Adolfo to live in hiding with his friend Alessandro Sgatti and his family in Marina di Carrara (known during the war as Apuania). Luciana was hidden by a Catholic family, and Adriana hid with her mother. Mario was arrested in March 1944 in Milan and deported to the Fossoli di Carpi concentration camp. He was deported in August 1944 to the Auschwitz concentration where he perished. After the liberation of Marina di Carrara, Alessandro took Adolfo to Milan to reunite with his mother and sisters. Alessandro and his family were recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations in 1981.

The collection consists of letters written by Benvenuto Mario Vitta (Mario) in 1944 to his wife Ines and daughter Adriana who were in hiding. The letters were likely written in Milan and the Fossoli di Carpi concentration camp. There is also one letter to Mario from his friend Alessandro Sgatti who was hiding Mario's son Adolfo with his family in Marina di Carrara.
