'Tran und Helle' dialogue re. listening to foreign broadcasts on radio

Tran and Helle admire Tran's radio. Helle notes that Tran can hear all sorts of great programs from throughout the Reich. Tran says that he can also hear foreign news broadcasts, to which Helle replies that Tran could go to prison for such behavior. Even if Tran is not caught, says Helle, good Germans do not do such things. Helle continues to berate Tran for believing that foreign broadcasts tell the truth. Tran answers that he is old enough to tell if something is true and he turns on the radio. The voice of the radio announcer says that someone was just sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for listening to foreign broadcasts. Tran says he can also hear music from Paris. Helle replies that this is also forbidden, but that one can hear dance music from German radio stations. He turns the station and both Tran and Helle enjoy the music. Tran then wonders if he is entitled to a reduction in his radio tax since he will not be listening to any more foreign broadcasts. Tran and Helle were a comic duo who appeared in Nazi newsreels. In each episode Tran [dopey] made stupid mistakes which were corrected by Helle [brilliance].
