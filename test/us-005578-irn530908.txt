John Moskel photograph collection

folder

1

Contains photographs related to the wartime experiences of John Moskel (donor's late husband), who was a Private First Class in the 69th Infantry Division of the United States Army. Includes post-liberation photographs of the Buchenwald concentration camp as well as photographs of PFC Moskel's unit moving through Europe. Also included are photographs, likely picked up by PFC Moskel, that were apparently taken by German soldiers on the Eastern front, including images of Jews being hung, non-Jewish forced labor, and signs of bombing and destruction.
