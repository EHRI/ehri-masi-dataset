Kiedy | Oriental Tango

Circa 1947 recording featuring Polish popular jazz band exiled to Iran, "The Jolly Boys." Performers include Stanislaw Sperber, S. Helishkowski. The Jewish band found unexpected sanctuary in Tehran, where they had been invited to perform at the future Shah’s wedding party (in the summer of 1939), and where they continued to perform as a group until the war had ended. Although the “Jolly Boys” never made a commercial recording in Poland, the group did record several songs in Tehran. One bandmate, pianist Artur Baigelman (AKA “A. Bay”), one of Henry Baigelman’s many musical siblings, did not survive the war. Side A: Royal RT 105. Kiedy. Side B: Royal RT 105. Oriantal [sic]-Tango
