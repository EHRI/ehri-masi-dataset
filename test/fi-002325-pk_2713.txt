The Finnish Red Cross established its POW Office in 1939 to collect data concerning the POWs during the Winter War, and later during the Continuation War. The office was established on the ground of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of POWs.

The archive contains records from the years 1939-1948. It includes journals, correspondence, death certificates, as well as card indexes and lists of POWs, which are the archiveâ€™s main material.
