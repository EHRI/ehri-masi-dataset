Collection of photographs and documents relating to the Grünberg family from Krakow, Poland: Ziuta (b. October 11, 1927), daughter of Zygmunt ( b. Feb. 1, 1896), an architect, and Berta Miller (b. Nov. 7, 1898). Ziuta’s older brother, Roman (b. October 12, 1922) was sent by his father to a boarding school in London, on April 20, 1939. Zygmunt Grünberg was forced to become the chief architect and engineer of the Płaszów concentration camp. The family was deported to Auschwitz and Zygmunt was transferred to Flossenbürg and murdered there in the stone quarry on April 23, 1945. Ziuta and her mother were taken to Bergen-Belsen and transferred to Mauthausen; her mother died in the train. All the photographs are from 1939 and from the Krakow ghetto, c. 1941-1942. Includes two Kennkarten, with false identities, which were never used. The photographs and documents were saved by Rozia, the family's maid. An accretion of pre-war and wartime photographs and postwar correspondence relating to the Grünberg and Muller families added in November 2014.
