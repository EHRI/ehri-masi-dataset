Uri Hirschmann was born Helmut Martin Hirschmann in 1922 in Frankfurt am Main to Lazarus Hirschmann (1889-1938) and Hedwig Hirschmann (1894-approximatley 1941). Lazarus Hirschmann was a World War I veteran and owned a writing materials wholesale business. Uri left Germany for Palestine in March 1939, settled on a kibbutz, and married Zahava Shapira. His sister Margot (b. 1925) left in April on a Kindertransport to England, immigrated to the United States in 1944, and married Charles David Lobree. His mother perished in the Holocaust, but the circumstances are unknown. His grandmother Emma Scheuer (1866-approximatley 1942) was deported from Frankfurt in August 1942 to Theresienstadt, transferred in September to Maly Trostinec, and perished.

The Uri Hirschmann papers include a photo album, travel pass, and Palestinian naturalization certificate documenting Hirschmann’s family in Frankfurt am Main before the war and his relocation to Palestine. Photographs depict Hirschmann’s family, their home, bar mitzvah and Purim celebrations, and Hirschmann at a Hachschara camp in Germany, and a Youth Aliyah camp and a kibbutz in Palestine.
