Views of Copenhagen

Busy streets in downtown Copenhagen. Tram, lots of bicyclists. Pan up to the top of the City Hall and a nearby column with a statue of two Viking youths blowing a trumpet. Bicyclists fill the roadway. Views of people buying and selling at the fish market. A woman wipes off, weighs, and sells eels. A Danish flag blows in the breeze.
