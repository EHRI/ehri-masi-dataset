United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of one memoir, referred to in the text as a CV or Vitae, by Dr. Zvi Richter, who was born Budapest, Hungary and raised in Berehovo. In the memoir, Dr. Richter describes life in Berehovo, the Jewish and Zionist community, establishing his own law firm, and his memory of the Hungarian occupation in 1938. He served in the Horthy army for a brief period in 1940, but was recalled after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. As a Jewish soldier, he witnessed the effects of the massacres and deportations of Jews in the areas in which he served until 1943, when he was captured and imprisoned by the Soviet Army. In 1944, he was able to join the Czechoslovakian Brigade and, at the end of the war, discovered that save one brother, his entire family was murdered in the Holocaust. In 1949, Dr. Richter, with his wife and young daughter, immigrated to Israel. The memoir was recorded by Elisabeth Jaari in Tel Aviv on August 1, 1966.
