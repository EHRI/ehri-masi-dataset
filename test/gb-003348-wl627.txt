They managed to survive the war and stay on in Hungary until shortly after the Russian invasion in 1956 when George and Irma successfully attained refugee status in Switzerland and Judit came to England. Livia, the other daughter died in 1947.</p><div style="border: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; color: #201f1e; text-decoration-color: initial;"><p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Regina (Riza) Weisz (1875-1963) married Zsigmond (Sigismund) Paunz (Paunc, Pauncz) who was I believe a grain merchant.

<p>The papers in this collection document the lives of a Hungarian Jewish family which managed to survive the Holocaust thanks, in large part, to the efforts of the Swedish diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg. Of particular interest is material relating to Nazi persecution at 627/4 and 627/5. There is evidence of a relationship with Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved the lives of some 90,000 Jews in Hungary. George Brody was made a manager of one of the properties bought by the Swedish government in Budapest to give protection to Jewish citizens.</p><p>This collection also contains material on the lives of George and Irma's forbears. Included amongst which are papers relating to Samu and Ilona (George's parents) and to Sigismond Brody, (George's great uncle?), a famous Hungarian newspaper magnate who founded the <em>Neues Pester Journal</em></p>
