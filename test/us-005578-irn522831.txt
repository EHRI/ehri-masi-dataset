Fanny Flam papers

1

Fanny Flam was born Fanny Herman in Anderlecht, Belgium, on January 28, 1931, to Itzhack (Jacques) and Gittle (Giselle) Zysman. During the Nazi occupation of Belgium, Fanny, her parents, and her two older brothers, Marcel and Paul, escaped to Mandelieu-la-Napoule in the south of France and remained together in hiding. When French police arrested Jacques and Giselle Zysman in 1943, their children devised a plan to escape to Switzerland.

The papers consist of correspondence, documents, identification cards, and a notebook containing pieces of coupons and ration cards that relate to the experiences of Fanny Herman, donor, and her family during their pre-World War II life in Belgium, during their time in hiding in the south of France, and during their escape to Switzerland.
