Soviet POWs; Soviet village

Hundreds of Soviet POWs march down the road; women seen working in orchards in BG. Shot of POW line extending into the distance. Shots of damaged/wrecked Soviet equipment (vehicles, cannons, ammunition) abandoned at both sides of road. VAR shots of poor Soviet village. Very poor hovels, elderly kerchiefed women, and pans of children (narration: "here is the paradise of farmers and workers... these children have no mothers, no fathers") who pose for the camera. Brief view of grim "hospital" room with emaciated boys in beds. Corpses are dragged and laid out for peasants to identify (some CUs.) Narration indicates that these are atrocities committed by the KPU, more of which are discovered every day. HA shot of funeral procession: horse-drawn coffins (heavily draped with flowers) and crowds of people, also carrying flowers.
