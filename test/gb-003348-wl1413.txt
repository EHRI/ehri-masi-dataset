Marx family documents

1 folder

The son (the depositor), Robert Miller (formerly Marx), came to Great Britain in 1937 to attend school. His parents, Ludwig and Regina, left in 1939, the father having been incarcerated at Dachau in November 1938, from where he was released on the understanding that he would leave Germany for the USA, where a distant cousin ofthe mother had given an affidavit of support. It was on the strength of this that they received British (6 month) transit visas. The war stopped all further migration so their US visas were never acted upon. The whole family became naturalised British citizens in 1947, but in 1952 economic circumstances forced the parents to return to Germany whilst the son remained in Great Britain.
