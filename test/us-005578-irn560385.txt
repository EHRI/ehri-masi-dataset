Hans Artz (1894-1975) was born to Heinz (Hanz) Arzt (1866-1931) and Sophie Ehrenhause (1869-1939) and had five siblings: Grete (1895-1987), Trude (1989-1988), Edith (1900-?), Erich (1902-1979), and Ruth (1911-1988). Heinz owned a liquor store and married Sophie in 1892. Heinz died in 1931 and Sophia moved into a boarding house and then a nursing home before passing away in 1939. Hans served in World War I and was a POW. After the war he took over his father’s business and married Lotte Hamburger (1891-1970, born to Julius (1856-1925) and Clara (1862-1939)) in 1924. They lived in Berlin and had two children, Susi (b. 1925) and Hannelore (Lore, b. 1928). After his business was taken from him because he was Jewish in 1938, Hans and his family decided to leave Germany. Hans, Lotte, and their daughters left for the Dominican Republic in October 1938. They immigrated to the United States in 1947. In 1933 Trude, her husband Richard Bail (1899-1971), and their children Gerte (b. 1922), Heinz (1923-1982), and Lutz (b.1926-1976) left for Czechoslovakia where they opened a photography studio. After their residence permit expired in 1936 or 1937, they moved to Prague and attempted, unsuccessfully, to immigrate to France. In 1938 they moved to Italy and sent their sons to school in Palestine in 1939. Trude and Richard moved to Palestine in 1945 and eventually settled in the United States. Ruth went to Paris around 1933 as a German-speaking governess. She briefly returned to Germany before leaving again for Sweden. When her visa renewal was denied she was sent back to Germany. In 1936 she was arrested and interned at Moringen concentration camp for nine months before she was released and left for Palestine. She married Heinz Warschauer (b. 1906) and had a son, Dan (b. 1945). They immigrated to the United States in 1950. In February 1936 Grete, her husband Peter Philipsborn (1892-1972), and their son Fritz (b.1922) immigrated to the Dominican Republic where they opened a store. After the war they immigrated to the United States and settled in California. Edith married Kurt Bail (1896-1985) and they had two daughters, Hilla (b.1922) and Evlein (Eva, b.1923). Edith and Kurt divorced in 1936 and Edith and her daughters were forced to leave Germany in 1939. They went to England where Edith found work and Kurt went to Bolivia. Erich, his wife Hanni Dussek (b. 1905), and their daughter Ruth (Lütte, b. 1933) sailed for Chile in June 1939.
