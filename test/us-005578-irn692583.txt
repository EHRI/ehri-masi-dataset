Seymour Krieger (1913-1959) was born in East Orange, New Jersey and served with the Office of the U.S. Chief of Counsel under Justice Robert H. Jackson during the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg from 1945 and 1946. He worked to discover, collect, examine, and translate information that resulted in the indictments against Nazis for crimes against Allied soldiers and prisoners of war and for the persecution of Jews. After his service in Nuremberg, he returned to Washington, D.C. where he continued practicing law and opened his own firm. Seymour married Rita (née Zachary, circa 1913-1982) and they had a son Julian and a daughter Deborah.
