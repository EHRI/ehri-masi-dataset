Consists of one memoir, 65 pages, entitled "My Account: The Honest Truth" by Magda Klein Dorman, originally of Kecskemét, Hungary. She describes persecution after the German invasion of Hungary and the memory of her father being taken for forced labor in April 1944. After a brief attempt to be assigned labor outside the city, Magda was forced to return to Kecskemét, where she was interned in the ghetto and then at the brick factory outside of town. She was deported to Auschwitz in June 1944, where her mother was killed upon arrival. She describes life in Auschwitz, being quarantined with scarlet fever, and being deported in September 1944 to Bergen-Belsen, and from there, to Salzwedel, a subcamp of Neuengamme. She worked in a munitions factory there until her liberation, when she was sent to Camp Vasser in the British zone of occupation. She returned to Hungary and reunited with her father.
