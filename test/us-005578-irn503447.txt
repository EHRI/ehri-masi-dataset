Jacoby, Klaus

Edith Jacoby was born in Worms, Germany, ca. 1899. She married Kurt Jacoby in the 1920s. Instead of attempting to emigrate to the US, the Jacobys fled into Poland to avoid Nazi persecution. The two Jacoby children, Klaus and Irene, were sent by children's transport to live in England. Kurt Jacoby died shortly thereafter and Edit Jacoby was deported to the Warsaw Ghetto. She was later killed at Treblinka

Consists of a letter written by Edith Aron Jacoby from the Warsaw Ghetto, during the period 25 January through 18 March 1943. Jacoby's letter describes the climate of severe anxiety and grief after spending three years in the ghetto. She tells of changes in her physical appearance due to stress and her strong desire to be reunited with her children. Also included is a second letter (21 January 1946) from Maria-Ruth Kadlubowska, an acquaintance of the Jacoby family. Kadlubowska informs Josephsohn of the conditions in Poland and the Trawniki concentration camp near the time of her sister's death. The two German letters are preceded by a commentary, in English, by the donor, Inge Worth.
