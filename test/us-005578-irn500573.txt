Katarina Grünsteinová (nee Feldbauer) was born on March 15, 1922 to Moric and Franziska Feldbauer. Katarina and her older borther, Bernhard, grew up in Senica, Czechoslovakia. They lived there until Nazi occupation, when they were deported to Bratislava-Patronka concentration camp, and following that, to Auschwitz, where Katarina’s entire family was killed. She was transported to Ravensbrück in 1944, and later to Malchow in 1945, where she was liberated. After the war she lived in Prague and eventually married Robert Grünstein.

Items include two postcards sent while Katarina was in Auschwitz-Birkenau, a Red Cross card, a camp newsletter, and a court decision ordering her father Moric, to dissolve his company. Other items include two newspapers, a copy of Katarina’s Czech memoir, and a small booklet about her hometown during the Holocaust.
