It stated that the voivodship police is an organization of the security service and has the task of maintaining security, peace and public order, and in this respect is the executive body of the voivodeship administration authorities. Organizationally, the police were adapted to the administrative division of the province, divided into the Main Police Headquarters of the Silesian Province with headquarters in Katowice, poviat and city headquarters (for cities constituting poviats), police stations in cities and larger municipalities or districts of larger cities, and posts in municipalities and smaller cities. In the field of organization, administration, supply, weaponry and training, the voivodship police was subordinate to the chief commandant, while in the area of security service and executive actions of administrative authorities subordinated to the voivode, and in poviats - starosts, in the districts for which police directorates were established (Katowice, Chorzów), Bielsko) - police directors.
