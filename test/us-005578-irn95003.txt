Hermansdörfer family papers

1

The Hermansdörfer family lived in Łąka and Sambor, Poland (Luky and Sambir, Ukraine). They tried to obtain permission to immigrate to the United States in the years leading up to World War II with the help of Jennie Hermansdörfer Bieber, who had immigrated three decades earlier, but they were not successful. The entire family is believed to have perished in the Holocaust. Jennie Hermansdörfer (1888-1962) immigrated to the United States in 1908 and in 1910 married Bernard Bieber (1877-1959), who had immigrated in 1903. The couple lived in New York City and had two daughters, Sophie Bieber Acker (1911-1993) and Dorothy Bieber Nomberg (1919-2011).

The Hermansdörfer family papers consist of correspondence relating to the efforts of Jennie Hermansdörfer Bieber and her daughters Sophie Acker and Dorothy Nomberg to bring the Hermansdörfer family from Łąka, Poland (Luka, Ukraine) to the United States before the Holocaust. Correspondence includes letters of support from Adra Day, Elise Gilman, and Philip Acker to the American Consulate in Warsaw; a letter from Leon Hermansdörfer to the Acker family; a rejection letter from the Consulate; and a postwar letter from a cousin in Poland indicating that none of the Hermansdörfer family survived the Holocaust. The papers also include a postwar tracing form from the National Council of Jewish Women completed by Jennie Bieber in search of Dora, Leip, Pescha, Rebeka Lea, Israel, Adolph, and Sally Hermansdörfer.
