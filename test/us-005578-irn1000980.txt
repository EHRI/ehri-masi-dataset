Ferencz discusses reunification of Germany

One Germany. Host: Steven Roberts, US News and World Report, CBS News Nightwatch. Segment includes discussion among Roberts, Ambassador Jonathan Dean, US officer of the High Command in Germany who helped establish new German armed forces, Henry Kellerman, director of the office of German Public Affairs at the State Department in the early 1950s, and Benjamin Ferencz, prosecutor of Nazi war crime trials. The men discuss Germany as a single sovereign state. Topics include the causes that created a divided Germany, economic and social dislocation, reeducation of East Germany, democracy, and the importance in rebuilding European community. All did not expect unification in their lifetime. Ferencz quote excerpted at beginning of segment: "I think the unification will lead to a united Europe more than a united Germany. I think the idea of a German nation-state which threatened its neighbors, which existed in the past, I think that's finished."
