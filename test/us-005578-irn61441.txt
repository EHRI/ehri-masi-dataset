Frances Cutler Hahn was born Fanny Lindenberg Kahane on March 16, 1938 in Paris, France. Her parents, Schlomo Zalman Kahane and Cyla Lindenberg, came to Paris in 1936 from Poland. When Fanny was three, her parents placed her in a childrens' home prior to their own arrests. Cyla Kahane was deported on Convoy 11 from Drancy to Auschwitz in 1942, where she perished. After her father was warned that Fanny would soon be deported, he moved her to live with a Catholic family on a farm, where she remained until the end of the war. At the end of the war, Schlomo Kahane died in a hospital of tuberculosis. Fanny moved to several orphanages before immigrating to the United States with the assistance of HIAS, where she was adopted.
