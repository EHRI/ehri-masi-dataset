Consists of copies of widely reproduced images of Yugoslav survivors of the Dachau concentration camp. Also includes a typed excerpt from an article for "Stars and Stripes" written by Lt. Col. Lyman Heidtke, of the 310th Ordnance Battalion, in which he describes the Dachau concentration camp and the purposes of various areas of the camp. The excerpt and images were sent home by 2nd Lt. Robert C. March of the 334th Ordnance Battalion; when sending the material, March noted that the pictures were taken from an undeveloped roll of film from a confiscated German camera.
