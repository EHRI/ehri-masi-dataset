The Association of Jewish Merchants and Craftsmen (Vienna) was funded in 1928 with the aim of coordinating the Austrian Jewish business community’s efforts in various areas of the economy and public life. Unaffiliated with any political party, the association called for unity among Austrian Jewry, believing that, given the frequent economic crises and increasing nationalist distributions from ruin. In 1934, the Yad Harutzim (hand of the Diligent) Society of Jewish Craftsmen, founded in 1908, joined the association on an autonomous basis. The association published the journal “Die Wirshaft”; its chairmen were Joseoph Jolles and A. Taub. The organization’s activities ceased after the Nazi Anschluss of Austria.
