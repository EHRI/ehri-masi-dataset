Collection illustrating the post-war experiences of Henia Nusenbaum, born in Warsaw, Poland in 1915 and her daughter Sonia Nusenbaum, born in Otwock, Poland on January 1, 1944 [while her parents, Moniek and Henia, were in hiding after having fled the Warsaw Ghetto]. The collection includes postwar attestations that Sonia was born in hiding and therefore did not receive a birth certificate, materials in preparation for immigration in 1951 to the United States and naturalization paperwork. Also included are photographs of postwar life of Henia and Sonia in displaced persons camps including Bad Reichenhall and Feldafing in Germany. Moniek died of typhus while in hiding.
