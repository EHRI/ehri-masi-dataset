Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives

The collection consists of 13 linear feet of Child Adoption Case Files (Sub-series of the Holocaust-Era Record of the Jewish Labor Committee), arranged alphabetically by name. Files were created by the Child Adoption Program of the Jewish Labor Committee between 1946 and 1960. Size and contents of individual files vary greatly; contain brief biographies and photos of the children, as well as correspondence, memos, and other documentation relating to the support of each child. Some of these children were living in the Jewish Labor Committee-supported children's homes in France, Belgium, Palestine/Israel, and Poland, and some lived with parents or other guardians.
