From Sept. 1944 to Jan. 1945, Fritz Buchholz was a prisoner in Auschwitz for having talked against Nazi Germany and having disseminated foreign news that he had heard on the radio. On 19 June 1945, Buchholz was a German prisoner-of-war in a United States Army prisoner-of-war camp in Cherbourg, France.

Fritz Buchholz's report (dated 19 Jun. 1945) describes the following in Auschwitz-Birkenau: sadistic camp guards; torture of inmates; the deaths of Jewish prisoners in gas chambers; confiscation and stockpiling of the arrivals' property; and the destruction of the camp's crematorium by the Nazi guards before the camp was overrun by the Soviet military.
