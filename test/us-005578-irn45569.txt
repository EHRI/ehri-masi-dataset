Consists of two memoirs written by Ruth Scheuer Tsotsis, originally of Mainz am Rhein, Germany. The first, entitled "My Personal History," 3 pages written in 2012, describes Ruth's childhood, attending a Jewish school after 1936, her memories of Kristallnacht, and of the family's emigration to Mexico City in 1940. She also describes the fate of members of her extended family. In "When I was Ten--A Travelogue," 7 pages written in 1990, Ruth describes in detail her family's experiences leaving Germany in 1940, crossing through the Soviet Union, arriving in Japan, and emigrating by boat to South America. The family first attempted to go to Chile, but were unable to land; the family was finally granted permission to land in Mexico, where they survived the war.
