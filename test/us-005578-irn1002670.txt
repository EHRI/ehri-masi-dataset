Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia

VS of Lvov*. Liberated Western Ukrainian and Belorussian cities return to their normal life. VS of trains and train stations, people in transit, daily life in an urban area, families on train platforms, several shots of women and children, workers exiting trains with their bicycles in hand, people lining up outside of a movie theater, VS of workers at a textile factory, inspecting the raw materials for making fabrics. *This may not be Lvov; it seems to be Bialystok. There is a shot of the Catholic Cathedral in Bialystok. The entire section could be Bialystok, or it could be a quick cut to Bialystok to follows the narration ("Thousands of unemployed have received work in Bialystok"). There are signs in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish, which could be in either Bialystok or Lvov. A newspaper heading reads, in Russian, "Liberated Bialystok". This indicates that the footage was likely taken in or around either September 1939 or late July or August 1944: Bialystok was "liberated" (annexed) by the Soviet Union in September 1939, captured by the Germans in WWII, and again liberated by the Soviets on July 27, 1944. There is also a railroad sign that reads "Bialystok-C". Later, a sign "City Administration of Bialystok" confirms that, at least by this point, the footage is of Bialystok. Later the film shows the Red Army's victory over Polish forces, suggesting that it is the 1939 liberation, rather than the later date. Translation of narration: Newspapers are published daily. The best Soviet movies are shown at movie theatres. The post office is functioning. The new school year has begun. New workdays unlike the previous ones have come. Thousands of unemployed got jobs in Bialystok. Railway connections have been restored. Phone connections are being restored quickly. The guard of honor awaits the Commander of the Byelorussian Front on the platform at Bialystok railway station. Comrade Kovalev - the Commander of the Byelorussian Front. [A tablet on a building wall reads in Russian and Yiddish: "City Administration of Bialystok."] Life in the city is managed by a temporary administration. It gained great popularity among the local population. People come to the administration with every question they have. The Budget Commission chairman, a textile worker, Mar'ya Ivanovna Dyachuk, takes charge of the factory that was left by its previous owner-a capitalist. Comrade Dyachuk helps the factory committee to set up normal workflow. Henceforth the biggest factory in Bialystok is managed by its workers. For the very first time they would become the owners of their work.
