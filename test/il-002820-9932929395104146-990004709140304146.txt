Unser Angriff auf die marxistische Front

1 electronic resource (5 pages)

The file contains two articles, one named "Unser Angriff auf die marxistische Front" (Our attack against the Marxist Front), written by Paul Meier from Benneckenstein (2 pages long), the second one named "St√ºrmt die marxistischen Bollwerke" (Storm the Marxist Strongholds), written by City Councilor Engel from Berlin (3 pages long). Both do not contain a publishing date and are taken from a book/larger selection of articles, but at the beginning of the first article, there is a handwritten note "Jan 1932". The first article states that in the last elections in Mecklenburg, Hessen and Birkenfeld the civil parties were almost completely destroyed. In the next months agitation and propaganda need to be concentrated against Marxism, to prevent an afflux of voters towards the Communist Party. The soul of the German worker needs to be won over. It is explained how to do that regarding organization, instruction and press. The second articles states that, while in the past Social Democrates and Communists antagonized one another, they battle nowadays united against the National Socialists. They even use National Socialist Meetings to speek in front of large audiences, which is unacceptable. National Socialist Propaganda needs to take action against Communists and win the masses of workers and unemployed for the National Socialists.
