Joseph Taler (1923-2012) was born on 10 January 1923 in Rozwadów, Poland to Abraham (1897-1955) and Zosia (b. 1904) Thaler. Abraham was a lawyer and Zosia was a pharmacist. During the Holocaust the Talers all lived under false identities with forged identification documents supplied by the Polish Christian Resistance. Joseph continued to work under the name Józef Skwarczyński. His father hid under the name Stanisław Wójcicki and his mother under the name Stanisława Barańska. They each lived in separate locations while under occupation. After the war, Joseph studied medicine in Poland and Marburg, Germany. While in Marburg he married his girlfriend Bronisława Frenkiel (1924-2017) in 1948. Their son George was born in 1949. The family immigrated to the United States in 1950 and settled in Maryland. Joseph's parents immigrated to Canada in 1951.

The papers contain certificates, work permits, identification cards, receipts, postcards, photographs, and other documents related to Joseph Taler, originally of Rozwadów, Poland, including his survival during the Holocaust living under the false identity of Józef Skwarczyński and his life after the end of World War II.
