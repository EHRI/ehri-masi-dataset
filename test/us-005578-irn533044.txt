Ernst Schlochauer (1921-1961) was born in Berlin on 3 April 1921, and raised there until 1933, when his parents moved the family to France. Ernst studied at the Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris, but the family chose to return to Berlin in 1935, and Ernst completed his studies there in 1937, and left for Britain the same year, where he took the university entrance examination at Cambridge. As he and his brother were both in England, they set about trying to get their parents visas to immigrate, which they were ultimately successful in doing, and the Schlochauer family reunited in New York in 1941. Because of a congenital heart condition, Ernst was unable to serve in the U.S. Army during the war, but instead went to Queens College in Flushing, New York, where he earned a bachelor's degree in comparative literature in 1944, before moving on to graduate studies at Princeton University, where he earned his doctorate. After earning his graduate degrees, he taught at Queens College, specializing in Elizabethan drama. He met a classmate he had known from Berlin, Ursula (Kantorowicz) Smith, at a reunion in New York, and the two married in 1957. Ernst Schlochauer died of a heart ailment on 1 March 1961.
