Contains approximately 40 letters written by Aharon (Arnold) Rosenkrantz and his brother David (Dovid) Rosenkrantz to their parents, Josef and Pesia, in Vienna in 1938-1939, as well as a postcard of the ship Patria, in which one of the brothers, possibly both, boarded. Includes envelopes, with stamps removed. The collection also includes two letters by a brother from a Jewish summer camp in southern Austria in 1936, diary entries from Aaron from 1947, notebooks containing stories and poems written by Aaron, as well as birth certificates and his school and his physics and science studies notebooks. The family apparently came from Dresden and moved to Vienna to escape from the Nazis before the annexation of Austria. The parents were captured in Austria with the annexation and sent to concentration camps.
