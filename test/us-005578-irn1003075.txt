War Crimes Trials: film used as evidence in Ministries' Case (#11)

War Crimes Trials, Case 11 (Ministries Case). Footage pertains to Germany's entry into Austria. An old Austrian barracks is burned to the accompaniment of speeches, saluting, etc. Several night shots of the burning and collapsing building are featured. "Gros-Deutschland". Views of Graz, Bavaria: the streets, buildings, etc. Hitler arrives in his car, crowds heil. In a great hall, he stops on the way to the platform to smell a flower, shake hands with people. There are many WW I wounded in the audience. CUs, weeping and ecstatic people, wounded with crutches, etc. Himmler is among those listening to Hitler's speech (on the greater Germany). MCU, Hitler. A woman lifts the hand of an invalid soldier in salute. Cheers.
