Juliette Frisch Haymes was born in Paris in 1926 to Romanian immigrant Michel Frisch (1893‐1942) who had moved to France at the end of World War I. Three of his brothers immigrated to the United States and the fourth remained in Romania. Michel Frisch and his family were warned of the mass roundup of Jews that was going to take place in the middle of July 1942. He was arrested on July 16, sent to Drancy, deported to Auschwitz on July 22, and perished. His wife and daughters avoided deportation by hiding. Juliette obtained false identification papers in the name of Juliette Michel from a friend of a friend who worked at city hall in Saint‐Aaron, a small village near Lamballe (Côtes‐d'Armor), and spent the rest of the war in hiding with her mother and sister. Juliette immigrated to the United States after the war and married Charles S. Haymes (b. 1919).

The Juliette Frisch Haymes papers include authentic and falsified identification papers and ration tickets for Juliette Frisch; records documenting Michel Frisch's unfitness for military service and his deportation via Drancy to Auschwitz, including his last postcard to his family; and photographs of Juliette Frisch, her parents, sister, uncle Daniel, and great uncle Waldman.
