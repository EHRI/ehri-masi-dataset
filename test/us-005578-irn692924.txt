The poster was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

Spanish-language, Argentinian poster advertising the film, “None Shall Escape,” released by Columbia Pictures in 1944. “None Shall Escape” was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Story. The film jumps between a fictionalized post-World War II war crimes trial of a Nazi officer from Poland, and the events leading up to and during the war. The man is embittered after Germany’s defeat in World War I, becomes a follower of Adolf Hitler, rises in the ranks of the Nazi party, and returns to terrorize his home village. The film was inspired by President Franklin Roosevelt’s announcement that the United Nations’ intention of identifying Nazi leaders, and called for them to be tried for war crimes. It not only depicted the Nazi persecution of women, but also their persecution of Jews. The film depicted the mass killing of Jews by German machine gunners, and featured a rabbi as a central character. Although the film was released 15 months before the end of the war, it bore strong parallels to the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, following his capture in Argentina by the Israeli Mossad. Unlike the Nuremburg trials, the Eichmann trial featured the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
