Prisoners of Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps in Oswiecim were freed by Ukranian Front of Soviet Army.
Corpses of tortured prisoners could be found in camps among crematories and gas chambers and on the nearby territory. Some of them were killed during the Nazi retreat.
Prisoners who were killed in camps were buried in Oswiecim, and those who were able to survive underwent the physical checkup: they were found to be extremely exhausted during incarceration.
Some of the former camp prisoners were taking part in technical and forensic expertise together with Soviet scientists and members of State Committee.
