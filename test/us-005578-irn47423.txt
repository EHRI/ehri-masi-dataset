Chaim and Sara Jakira (b. 1889) Blankman had one son, Abraham (b. 1930) and lived in Dubno, Poland (Dubno, Ukraine). Chaim immigrated to Palestine in 1935 but Sara and Abraham remained in Poland. During World War II Sara and Abraham perished in the Lwów Ghetto in around 1941 or 1942. Chaim’s father, Zvi Hersh Blankman, his brother Jakob with his wife and two daughters were all murdered in Dubno in 1942.

The collection consists of pre-war photographs documenting the Blankman family in Dubno, Poland (Dubno, Ukraine) prior to Chaim Blankman's immigration to Palestine in 1935.
