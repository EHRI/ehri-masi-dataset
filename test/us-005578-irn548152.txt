Documents and correspondence; farewell party invitation for Bertl Pick [donor's mother] who immigrated to United States from Hamburg, Germany in 1939; wedding announcement for Friedel Altmann and Herbert Zirker [donor's cousin], dated 1938, Neustadt, Germany; letters regarding immigration of Carola Schwarzenberger [who was Herbert's second wife] and her parents. Carola immigrated from Karlsruhe, Germany in 1938 and, according to correspondence, worked to find sponsors or assist for her parents, Leon and Ida Schwarzenberger, without success. Both were deported to separate French internment camps: Ida was deported to Récébédou and Drancy, then Auschwitz on August 12, 1942, where she is presumed to have been killed. Leon was deported to Gurs, Rivesaltes and Nexon internment camps in France. Records indicate he died in Nexon on December 28, 1942 and is buried there.
