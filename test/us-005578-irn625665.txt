Dezsö Becker (1896-1945) was born in 1896 in Bistra, Alba, Romania to Mátyás (1861-1935) and Frida Becker (1867-1952). He had five siblings: Leopold, Izsö, Anna (b. 1900), Ester, and Leslie. Anna and Ester immigrated to the United States in the 1920s. Frida joined her daughters there in 1937. Dezsö was a veteran of World War I and married Kato Irsai (Schwarz, 1899-1945?). Kato was born in Budapest, and had one brother, István (1896-1968). Dezsö worked as a bookkeeper and he and Kato lived in Budapest. They had one son, Ivan Endre Becker (nicknamed Van in the U.S., 1929-2009). In 1940 Dezsö was conscripted into a forced-labor brigade. He was later deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp where he perished. Dezsö’s brothers also perished during the Holocaust. Ivan attended school until the German occupation of Budapest in March 1944. In December 1944 Ivan and his mother were marched with other Jews to a brickyard in Budapest and then towards the Austrian border. Ivan was separated from Kato at the Hegyeshalom railroad station and never saw her again. He was rescued by Raoul Wallenberg or one of his associates, and sent back to Budapest Ghetto where he survived the duration of the war in a Swedish-protected safe house. After Budapest was liberated in January 1945, Ivan returned to his family’s apartment. He then travelled to Oradea, Romania searching for surviving relatives from his father’s family. Finding none, Ivan left Hungary with the Aliyah Bet and went to the Bad Gastein displaced persons camp in Austria. He immigrated to the United States in 1946 and settled in New York. He served with the United States Army during the Korean War. Ivan married Nancy Greenglass (b. 1941) in 1962 and had a successful career in the plastics business. Ivan and Nancy had two sons: David Michael (b. 1964) and Kenneth Andrew (b. 1967). After his retirement, he was involved in Holocaust education and served on the board of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
