Dr. Alexander Georg Bachur, a German Jewish lawyer, was born on September 7, 1883 in Hamburg. Already since 1935, citizens of Jewish origin were no longer allowed to be represented by so-called "German-Aryan" lawyers due to a decree of the "German Legal Front." According to the 5th Ordinance on the Reich Citizenship Law of 27 September 1938, all Jewish lawyers admitted to German courts now had to leave the bar by November 30, 1938. This corresponded to a long-standing demand of the "Reichsgruppe Rechtsanwälte des Nationalsozialistischen Rechtswahrerbundes (NSRB)." In the Old Reich, 1,753 lawyers were affected; In Hamburg at that time there were still 67 Jewish lawyers admitted by the Higher Regional Court. On January 31, 1939, the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg initially allowed only seven of the total of 19 employees as consultants for the state district of Hamburg - following a ten-day prior authorization by the Reich Minister of Justice. Dr. Bachur's application for admission as a legal advisor was initially rejected. In September 1939, however, he entered the aftermath of the emigrated Dr. Wulff and continued its business in the offices in Humburg on the Schauenburgerstraße 14. Dr. Bachur was deported to Łódź ghetto on October 25, 1941, where he died on October 9, 1942.
