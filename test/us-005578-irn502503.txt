William A. Davis (1908-1999) served with the U.S.A. Medical Corps and was appointed to the United States of America Typhus Commission established by President Roosevelt’s executive order. He arrived in London in October 1944, was attached to the British 21st Army Group, and worked in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. In April 1945 he was ordered to report to the Deputy Director of Medical Services, Second Army, at Bergen-Belsen. He was put in charge of typhus control and made responsible for delousing the prisoners, vaccinating key personnel, helping with diagnosing cases, and isolating the typhus strain. He published articles about typhus at Bergen-Belsen in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 1947 and the Annals of Internal Medicine in 1951. After the war, he worked at the Veterans Administration hospitals in Grand Junction, CO and Tucson, AZ.
