Documentation regarding the Jews of Germany, mainly during the Holocaust

1672 Files New documentation is added to this collection on regular basis

The Yad Vashem Archives began to collect the documentation in 1954. The Yad Vashem workers organized and catalogued the material not in the format of individual documents, but rather as a collection including organization of the files by subject. The rest of the documentation in the Record Group is personal documentation submitted to the Yad Vashem Archives and continuing to arrive here.

Most of the documentation is from Jewish sources. The first 106 files are remnants from the archives of Jewish institutions, organizations and communities in Germany.Some of this Record Group consists of documentation photocopied from municipal archives in Germany regarding the Jews and including personal documents, surveys and articles regarding the destruction of the communities in Germany and more. There is also documentation included in the Collection regarding the Jewish school in Harlingen, 1933-1939, submitted by the principal of the school, Hugo Josef Rosenthal-Jashuvi, to Yad Vashem.
