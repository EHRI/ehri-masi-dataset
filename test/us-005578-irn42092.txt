The Ernest Sterzer memoir consists of a copy of a memoir, 23 pages, untitled, by Ernest Sterzer, originally of Vienna, Austria. In the memoir, which is in English, Mr. Sterzer describes his experiences as an insulin-dependent diabetic during the Holocaust, including his family's 1942 deportation to Theresienstadt (Terezin), and the lengths his family went to in order to obtain insulin. In October 1944, he was deported to Auschwitz, where he eventually went into the hospital because he didn't have insulin. He was deported to Heinkel, Germany, where he performed forced labor, sporadically obtaining insulin, and from there, to Oranienburg. He was liberated on a death march by the American Army near Schwerin, Germany on May 2, 1945.
