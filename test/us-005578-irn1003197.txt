Stalhelm troops with Hohenzollern and Seldte

Title: "Editor's Note: For the last few months there have been rumblings of a revival of monarchistic sympathies in Germany. This picture, the first of the former Crown Prince deliberately accepting the spotlight, is confirmation of a situation which may have great influence on the immediate affairs of the embattled Reich." Crown Prince Wilhelm reviews Stahlhelm troops. Franz Seldte speaks: the Prussian and German future will be no accident but is dependent upon the Prussian race and Prussian blood, and is not possible without the King of Prussia. The camera cuts away from Seldte during his speech and focuses on Prince Wilhelm, who speaks briefly to the man next to him - his words are picked up by the audio but not quite distinguishable. Franz Seldte would later serve as the Rich Minister of Labor from 1933 to 1945. A World War I veteran himself, he helped found the "Stahlhelm" [steel helmet], a nationalist veteran's organization, which grew to be one of the largest paramilitary organizations in the Weimar Republic.
