Jerzy Flajszman (born Juda Ber Flajszman) was born on November 18, 1927, in Łódź, Poland. In February 1940, Jerzy, his mother, and his sister were forced into the Łódź ghetto. His father, Symcha, escaped to the Soviet Union where he survived World War II. Czarna Chawa and Chaja Sura Flajszman worked in the tailoring workshop (Schneider Abteilung) until September 1944 when they were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp and killed upon arrival. Jerzy worked in metal workshops (Metal Abteilung II) on Zgierska 56 in the Łódź ghetto. In August 1944 he was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. After a month and a half, he was transferred to Görlitz concentration camp (a sub-camp of Gross Rosen), where he worked in the “WUMAG” factory. The Soviet Army liberated him in May 1945. After liberation, he returned to his hometown of Lodz, Poland. In June 1951 he was married to Zofia Kolczycka. They emigrated from Poland to Sweden in 1969.

Zofia Kolczycka was born in Łódź, Poland on January 4, 1928. She was the only daughter of pharmacist Nachman (Natan) Kolczycki and Miriam Itelson Kolczycki. The family was forced into the Łódź Ghetto in February 1940. In August 1944, Zofia and her parents were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Nachman and Miriam perished in the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1944. In September 1944, Zofia was transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, and in November 1944 she was transferred to Elsing (a sub-camp of Buchenwald). Zofia was wounded during an American bombing of the camp in April 1945, and was then liberated by the Soviet Army in May 1945. Zofia returned to Lodz-Helenowek, a children’s home, where she was until 1948. In 1951, she was married to Jerzy Flajszman. They emigrated from Poland to Sweden in 1969.
