Hitler and Hindenburg in open car

Fox Movietone News. Aerial shots of crowds at the Lustgarten on May Day. A car carrying Hitler and von Hindenburg drives through; they wave to the crowds of schoolchildren (identified by narrator -- children not especially visible). The view switches to Hitler speaking briefly at the microphone, then shows von Hindenburg at microphone. They both solicit cheers from the crowd.
