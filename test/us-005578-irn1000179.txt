The streets are filled with hills of broken buildings and wreckage. Mayors try to rally their citizens. The pathetic Volksturm - the home guard - surrenders, to join the thousands of combat troops previously captured. Frantic, hungry civilians break into ruined stores and stalled trains to steal food and clothing. "German Atrocities" Allied armies free thousands of slave laborers - both men and women - from the infamous concentration camps. The victims hands had been mutilated, and numbers tattooed on their arms. One tremendous graveyard contains 30,000 dead. The occupant of each grave had been sent there by Nazi torture and barbarism. "Germany in Ruins" The Allies continue to pile up crushing defeats on the Nazis as they rush eastward from the Rhine. Heidelberg University is entered. Only shells of the ancient buildings are standing, while a modernistic building built by US funds reveals the generosity of American financiers and philanthropists. At Coblenz, the huge bridge lies broken in the Rhine, and doughboys maintain the "Watch on the Rhine." General Bradley and General Patton attend flag raising ceremonies at Ehrenbreitstein Castle.
