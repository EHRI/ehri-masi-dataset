Contains thirty-one pamphlets, most of which had been distributed on the streets in Nazi Germany; copies of "Das Jahr im Bild," "Der St√ºrmer," "Berliner Zeitung," "Berliner Tageblatt"; a speech delivered in the Reichstag by Adolf Hitler; "Dr. Goebbels auf dem Reichsparteitag 1935: Kommunismus ohne Maske"; "Max Schmelings Sieg-ein deutscher Sieg"; and "RAK." The material was collected by Ettore Peretti, an American student living in Germany in 1935-1936. Some of the leaflets were also published in English to show English-speaking visitors examples of what was being published in Nazi Germany.
