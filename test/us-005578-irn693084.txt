The advertisement was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

Advertisement from the February 1, 1943 issue of “Life” Magazine, featuring photos and text relating to the films, “Hitler’s Children” and “Education for Death.” Both films were adapted from Gregor Ziemer’s novel, “Education For Death,” which was based on the author’s experiences and observations as the former headmaster of Berlin’s American Colony School. “Hitler’s Children” focused on a young American woman in Germany, who denounced Nazi ideology and the state-sanctioned treatment of women as vessels for procreation, was forced into a labor camp, subjected to public flogging, and eventually executed. The film, “Education for Death,” was an animated short by Walt Disney Productions, and centered on a young German boy who is indoctrinated with Nazi ideology, and becomes a mindless soldier devoted to Adolf Hitler. It was one of 32 propaganda shorts Disney produced under a contract for the United States government. In addition to propaganda, the Disney studios also produced a series of instructional films for government and military personnel. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
