Manfred Haber (later Fred Haber, 1925-2018) was born on 8 March 1925 in Vienna, Austria to Raphael Haber and Dora Seidler Haber. His father Raphael (1881-1942) was born on 18 March 1889 in Panka, Romania to Moses Haber and Chaje Eisinger Haber. He had six siblings and worked as a typesetter. Manfred’s mother Dora (1896-1942) was born on 1 December 1896 in Czernowitz (Chernivtsi, Ukraine) to Salomon Seidler and Brucha Hilfgott Seidler. She worked as a typesetter. Manfred had one sister, Gertrude (Trudy, b. 1929). During Kristallnacht in November 1938, Raphael was arrested and imprisoned in Dachau. After his release, Raphael arranged for Manfred and Trudy to go from Vienna to France, where they boarded a ship and immigrated to the United States. Manfred enlisted with the United States Army in 1943. He served first with the 36th Infantry Division, and later as a member of the Signal Corps. Both of Manfred’s parents were murdered in the Holocaust. Raphael and Dora lived in Antwerp, Belgium by April 1939.

Dora was deported from Mechelen to Auschwitz on 15 August 1942 where she perished. After the war, Manfred earned a degree in electrical engineering. He married Joy Perlow and they had two sons: Robert and Theodore.
