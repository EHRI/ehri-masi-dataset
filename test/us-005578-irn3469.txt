Issue of Der St端rmer, a viciously anti-Jewish newspaper published by Julius Streicher, an early Nazi Party member, from 1923-1945 in Germany. The newspaper's slogan was "Die Juden sind unser Ungl端ck!" [The Jews are our misfortune]. The paper thrived on scandal, and preferred sensational stories of Jews committing disgusting, evil acts. It was also infamous for its antisemitic cartoons and staff cartoonist Fips. Streicher was arrested by the US Army in May 1945. He was tried by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, convicted, and executed per the ruling that his repeated articles calling for the annihilation of the Jewish race were a direct incitement to murder and a crime against humanity.
