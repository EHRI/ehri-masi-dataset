Text only, lithographic wartime poster used in Great Britain to promote public travel between times that would not interfere with the commutes of workers essential for the war economy. After the fall of France, in June of 1940, Great Britain was left alone to withstand the full force of the German military. The country needed every citizen to do their part and assist in national defense. The poster was issued by the Ministry of Labour & National Service and the Ministry of War Transport for publication by Her Majesty’s Stationary Office (HMSO). The Ministry of War Transport was created to control shipping, public and private transportation policy, safety, and the resources of Great Britain during World War II. The Ministry of Labour was responsible for managing Great Britain’s economy, including human and material resources, and turned it into a war economy focused on production for the war effort. Workers were tied to jobs that were considered essential and employers were prevented from terminating workers without permission from the government. The HMSO was founded in the 1780s to provide documentary support and paper based supplies for the British government. The office was instructed to supervise the printing of 78 million ration books and instruction manuals on everything from cooking to air raids before the outbreak of World War II.
