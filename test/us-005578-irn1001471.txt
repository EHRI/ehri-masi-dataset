Refugees arrive at Ellis Island

Refugees arriving at Ellis Island on the "Marine Flasher" ship. Crowd waving. A scuffle breaks out among refugees, one woman is visibly upset and yelling toward the camera. Refugees embrace, some with bundles. CU of a woman holding a baby. Side view of a boy waving. Various shots of two children. Two women show tattoos to camera (they seem to be mother and daughter, but this is not confirmed.)
