Rose (Rochel) Goldberg was born to Avraham and Frieda (n√©e Glogower) Goldberg in Warsaw, Poland, in 1922. The second eldest of the couple's five children, Rose had three brothers, Yankel (1915-?), Smulak (1924-?) and Shlomo (1927-?), and a sister Lipche (1927-44). Rose's father was the proprietor of a small currency exchange business. Avraham was shot and killed in the street while the Goldberg family was forced into the newly constituted Warsaw ghetto in 1940. In 1942 Rose's eldest brothers, Yankel and Smulak, were taken away under the auspices of forced labor. The following year Rosa, Frieda, Lipche, and Shlomo attempted to hide during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. During that time Shlomo was separated from his mother and sisters. Rose, Frieda, and Lipche were subsequently deported to Majdanek where Frieda was separated from her daughters and sent to the gas chambers. Rose and Lipche were later transferred from Majdanek to the Skarzysko-Kamienna forced labor camp. Rose was a witness to the killing of her sister at the camp in 1944. After liberation Rose returned to Warsaw where she hoped to find surviving relatives to find that all of her loved ones had perished. In Warsaw Rose met Severin "Sam" Zarembski (1917-2009) who had fought in the ghetto uprising and survived multiple concentration camps. The couple left Poland in 1945 and lived for two years as displaced persons in Germany. Rose and Severin lived in displaced persons camps in Straubing and Pocking, Germany, where they married in April 1946. During this time Rose sought out relatives in the United States and wrote to them of what she had endured. In September 1947 the couple immigrated to the United States aboard the Marine Flasher. The Zarembskis ultimately settled in New York where they welcomed a son and daughter.

The letters were authored while Rose was living in a displaced persons camp in Straubing, Germany. Rose was a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto, Majdanek, and other camps. Also included are newspapers clippings listing Rose as a Holocaust survivor looking for relatives after the war.
