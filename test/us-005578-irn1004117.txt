French occupation of the Ruhr

Graphic of a boot coming down on a Ruhr skyline, followed by a quotation from William Tell. A map shows the Ruhr area and the towns that are occupied by the French. A title onscreen asks why the French occupied the Ruhr in the first place, followed by shots of the bustling coal industry. Shots of French troops on the streets. Panning shot of stationary rail cars filled with coal.
