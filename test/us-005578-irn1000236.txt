Rosenberg speaks on Nazi ideology, anti-Bolsehvik, anti-Jewish

Alfred Rosenberg speaks to camera (interview-style) about the responsibility Hitler gave him in the occupied Eastern territory to eliminate Bolshevism and Marxism and complete the NSDAP revolution against [them and] Judaism and democracy. Also talks about German Volk and the different types of people. Partial translation from Raye Farr's notes (1972): "A battle of racial souls....In his writings...tried to establish a 'typos' of the German people, in contrast to other peoples. World history has been a battle of racial souls....the relation between Earth and Volk....Weltanschauung.... don't think it was my opinion alone.... Hitler appointed me ?? in the occupied Eastern territory...so I'm charged with the responsibility of eliminating Bolshevism and Marxism and completing the NSDAP revolution...against the whole complex of Marxism/Judaism/Democracy....We are fighting against these Weltanschauungs, leading to a new time...."
