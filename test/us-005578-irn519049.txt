The memoir, which was edited by Mr. Mayer's grandson, Ron Gery, describes the experiences of Richard and Hella Weiskopf Mayer who escaped, with their young daughter, Astrid Miriam Mayer (later Miriam Gery), from Yugoslavia to Palestine during the Holocaust. Mr. Mayer describes his memories of the German invasion of Yugoslavia, the confiscation of goods and property, and the difficulty both in traveling and in leaving the country. The Mayers eventually managed to escape Yugoslavia and to spend time in Italy before they were able to emigrate to Palestine through northern Africa.
