Rudolph Jacobson was born Rudolf Cohen in 1933 in Insterburg (East Prussia), Germany. His parents divorced the following year, and his mother, Margarethe (Greta, 1908-?)), married Erich Jacobsohn (1902-1952). The family moved to Bamberg, where Erich was employed by the Herman Teitz Company. Rudolph’s half-brother, Thomas Michel was born in 1938. During Kristallnacht Rudolph’s stepfather was arrested and sent to Dachau. He was released only after Margarethe had purchased tickets on the MS St. Louis and secured Cuban landing permits thereby proving their intention to leave Germany. The Jacobsons set sail aboard the MS St. Louis on May 13, 1939. When the ship was forced to return to Europe, the family was given refuge in Holland. They went first to Rotterdam and later were interned in the Heijplatte. In November 1939 the family's quota number came up allowing them to immigrate to the United States. In late January 1940, after receiving sponsorship and money for the journey from Erich's cousin, Fanny Osterrman, they sailed from Rotterdam to America. They landed in Hoboken, New Jersey on February 9, 1940 and changed their last name to Jacobson.

The Jacobson family papers contain letters and telegrams between the Ostermann and Jacobson families documenting the Jacobson family's attempts to immigrate to the United States; two American Joint Distribution Committee press releases and a letter documenting the voyage of the MS St. Louis; a photocopy of a letter Erich Jacobson wrote to his family from Dachau concentration camp in 1938; a newspaper clipping announcing Erich Jacobson's death in in 1952; and a photocopy of a clipping memorializing the MS St. Louis.
