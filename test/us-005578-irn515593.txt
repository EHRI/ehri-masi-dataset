Charles Froelicher (1923-1992) was born in Switzerland and immigrated to the United States with his parents, Victor and Helen Froelicher, in 1924, settling in New Jersey. During World War II, he served with the U.S. 6th Armored Division which liberated Buchenwald in April 1945. In late June, along with Jake Ruppert, Max Hagenauer, and Alex Castle, he was assigned to accompany a transport of children from Buchenwald to Switzerland. The transport had been organized by Swiss Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In December 1945 he was assigned as Agent in Charge of the Counter Intelligence Corps in Donauw√∂rth, Germany.

The Charles Froelicher papers consist of photographs of the Buchenwald concentration camp and children who were part of the transport Charles Froelicher accompanied from Buchenwald to Switzerland in June 1945; a document issued by the Allied Expeditionary Force Military Government authorizing him to accompany the transport; two German language clippings about the transport; and a blank questionnaire used by the Counter Intelligence Corps for interrogating arrested Nazis. The photographs were taken by Charles Froelicher or other soldiers from the U.S. 6th Armored Division.
