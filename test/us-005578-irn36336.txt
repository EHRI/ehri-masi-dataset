Hinda Saul collection

folders

2

Consists of one folder of typed English language translations of letters sent from Nochum Berman in Šeduva (Lithuania), Lithuania, to Hinde Zarachaite (Zarkey), who immigrated to the United States in 1937. The letters are dated 1937-1940, and the later letters describe the beginning of the persecution of the Jews in Lithuania. Nochum Berman most likely perished in August 1941 as part of a roundup in Seduva. Also includes three facsimile autograph books, based on Hinda Saul's own autograph books, dated from 1934 in Widze (now Vidzy, Belarus) and 1936-1937 in Šeduva, and after her arrival in the United States.
