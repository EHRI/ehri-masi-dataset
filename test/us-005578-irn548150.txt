Collection of documents, correspondence, and photographs related to the Neubeck family in Dortmund, Germany, and the Werthamer family, originally from Kolomea, Poland. Heinz Neubeck (donor’s father, b. 1912) was arrested on Kristallnacht alongside 600 other Dortmund Jews; he was released on November 24, 1938 after a large “contribution” was paid for his return home. Heinz and Jetty Werthamer Neubeck (donor’s mother, b. 1912) left Germany on December 31, 1938 for Italy. A month later, on January 29, 1939 they sailed from Trieste on board S/S Conte Verde to Shanghai. They may have received financial help from HIAS (HICEM) for the purchase of the tickets. They settled in the French concession part of Shanghai. Their son, Reginald Joseph, was born on May 25, 1942. The family immigrated to the US on May 16, 1947. They settled in Seattle, WA, where Reginald after graduating from college had a long career at Boeing Co.
