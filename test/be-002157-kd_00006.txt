Index cards on Jews from Belgium interned in or deported from France. Collection

Fichier Drancy

35,888 digitised images (index cards)

This collection consists of index cards containing information on 9,765 Jewish men, women and children who in general lived in Belgium before the Second World War and who were interned in or deported from French internment camps during the war. The group of index cards for a specific person can contain a file card drafted by the Sicherheitspolizei-Sicherheitsdienst in 1941-1944 in case of a person who fled Belgium in or after 1941 and a research request filed by a relative. Every group of index cards for a specific person contains handwritten file cards with information gathered post-war by members of the Belgian Mission for Searches in France at internment camps, archives of Foreign Labour Groups and deportation lists. The content of each file allows researchers to reconstruct the path of a detainee or deportee.
