Young, Leo

Leo Young, the nephew of Maurice Jung, fled Austria after the Nazi invasion. Maurice Jung fled to France and was later taken prisoner by the Germans. It was at this point that his relatives in England lost track of him.

Includes letters exchanged between the Sam Jung family and J. A. Fox, a non-Jewish prisoner of war, and Fox's sister, E. A. Fox. The letters were written by Fox and his sister in order to inform Jung's family of his well being and whereabouts. Also included is a 1940 postcard from Maurice Jung to his brother Sam Jung; a recent letter from Leo Young to his children, nieces, and nephews telling the story of their uncle Maurice; and a photo of Maurice Jung and his wife with a caption on the back indicating it was taken in 1940. Photocopies of the documents were also donated by Young and are filed with the collection.
