Cassette dub. Sholom Secunda. Yizkor: in memory of the six million: an oratorio. Ethnic Music Pub Co, 1967 "Yizkor" (Hebrew, memorial prayer) is an oratorio created by Sholom Secunda (music) and Samuel Rosenbaum (text). The work premiered on ABC television's long-running religious program "Directions" in April 1973, and helped bring Holocaust history and commemoration to the attention of a broad American audience. The broadcast performance featured cantor Richard Tucker (lead singer) and Howard Da Silva (narrator); a recording was released on LP that same year.
