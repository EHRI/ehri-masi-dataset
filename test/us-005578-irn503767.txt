Edith Birkin was born in Prague in 1927. In 1941, she was sent with her parents to the ghetto of Łódź, Poland. In 1944, she was sent to Auschwitz and then to Christianstadt, a sub-camp of Gross-Rosen. In Jan. 1945, she was sent on a death march to Flossenbürg. After spending a short time there, she was transported to Bergen-Belsen, where she was at the time of its liberation. After the Holocaust, she joined a sister and immigrated to England

Although written as fiction, many of the details in "The unshed tears" are based on the experiences of Edith Hofman Birkin and her family during the Holocaust. It describes how the main character, Judith Baron, was deported from Prague to the Łódź ghetto and later to Monowitz; forced to work in Kristianstadt, a sub-camp of Gross-Rosen; and later participated in a death march. The manuscript also details her liberation and her attempts to return to a normal life. "The unshed tears" was written in 1950, soon after Edith Birkin arrived in England.
