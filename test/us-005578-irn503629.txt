Freibrun, Ms. Helen

Helen Freibrun (1926-2011) was born in Usharod, Czechoslovakia (now Uzhgorod, Ukraine). She had five brothers and one sister. The family was forced into a ghetto before being deported to Auschwitz concentration camp. Helen was tattooed with the number A999-1. Helen survived selections by Dr. Josef Mengele, and was eventually sent on a death march to Mauthausen concentration camp and Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Of their family, only Helen and one of her brothers survived the Holocaust. Helen met her husband, Jerry, in a displaced persons camp. They immigrated to the United States in 1947 and were married. Helen and Jerry Freibrun settled in Medford, New York and have one daughter. Helenâ€™s brother also immigrated to the United States and settled in New Jersey. He married and has three children.

The Helen Freibrun memoir consists of a photocopy of a typescript memoir containing information about Helen Freibrun's life in Usharod (Uzhgorod), Czechoslovakia, before the Holocaust; her experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp where she was involved in selections by Josef Mengele and interactions with a female Nazi named Ilse; her experiences in Mauthausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps; her survival of a death march; and the start of her new life in the United States. Also included is a photocopied photograph of Helen Freibrun and her brother six months after the end of World War II.
