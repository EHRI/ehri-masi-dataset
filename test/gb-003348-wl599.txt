The Jewish Refugees Committee, later the German Jewish Aid Committee, was founded in the early months of 1933 by Otto Schiff under the aegis of the Central British Fund for the Relief of German Jewry. Its tasks were to arrange for the admission of refugees to Britain, their maintenance, training, employment or re-migration. A number of provincial committees were formed to deal with issues regarding Jewish refugees in these areas.</p><p>The papers in this collection relate to the Leeds office, in particular the trainee department, a separate function of the control committee, supervised by David Makovski. In June 1939 it was agreed to allow the Leeds committee a budget of Â£250 per year<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>. In a report of the same committee dated 13 July 1939, it was mentioned that Mr Makofski was a member of the Control Committee but that the trainee department which he supervised had been run apart from the main committee.
