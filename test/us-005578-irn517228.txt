The papers consist of a false identification card ("Kennkarte") (two of three parts) issued to "Maria Szmigielska" [donor] from Zegota while she was in hiding. The Kennkarte was issued by the German police office in occupied Warsaw, Poland, and the donor received it through Zegota after escaping the Warsaw ghetto. The papers also include a photograph of Kolo Studentow Zycie (Circle of Jewish Students) in 1948 in Warsaw.
