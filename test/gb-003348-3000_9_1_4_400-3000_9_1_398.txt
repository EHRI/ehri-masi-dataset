Dr. Max Eschelbacher (1880-1964) was a liberal German rabbi and author. In 1912 he had been appointed Leo Back’s successor as rabbi of Düsseldorf. After being arrested in the wake of the November Pogrom 1938 he emigrated to England eventually. See Walk, J., , Munich et. al., K. G. Saur, 1988, p. 83.

The correspondence centres on Eschelbacher gathering and providing information on numerous Library enquiries on individuals as well as events. Furthermore, light is thrown on his involvement in the Library’s eyewitness testimony project including the contribution of an own account on his experiences in Düsseldorf during the November Pogrom 1938.
