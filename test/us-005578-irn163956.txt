Zenon Nowak was born on 16 December 1922 in Ruda Pabianicka, Poland, a suburb of Łódź. Records from the Dachau concentration camp show that he was brought to the camp by train on 26 May 1940 as a Polish prisoner ("Schutzhaftling"). Records indicate he may have been liberated from that camp, but are inconclusive.

Consists of one letter, dated November 10, 1941, written by Zenon Nowak to his mother, Anastasia Nowak, and sister, who were living near Litzmannstadt (Łódź). The letter was handwritten on Dachau concentration camp stationery, and both the letter and envelope bear Nowak's prisoner number, 12183.
