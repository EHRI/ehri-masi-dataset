The records of the Mayor’s Office were taken over by its successor, the City Council of Salgótarján in 1950. The City Council handed over the archival collection of the Mayor’s Office to the Salgótarján State Archives. The collection was re-arranged several times and reached its present form in the 2000s.

Mayor (polgármester) was the leading official of the towns and cities in Hungary. The mayor was elected by the Municipal Committee and his powers were regulated by the statutes created by the Committee as well as by Act XXI of 1886 (276. §.) The scope of authority of the Mayor was significantly broadened by Act XXX of 1930, which handed over most of the functions of the City Council to the Mayor’s Office. The Mayor’s Office included several departments according to its main administrative and economic functions.
