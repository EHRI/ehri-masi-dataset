Goebbels on Jews/German Art and Culture

Goebbels speaks from podium in philharmonic concert hall about expelling the Jews from artistic and cultural life. Shots of the audience seated. CUs of Goebbels speaking in SS uniform: "We have a German theater, a German film, a German press, and a German literature, a German art, and a German culture." Need for Jews to be eliminated from German culture. Sounds calm, confident. Huge swastika banner behind his head. The audience applauds. Portion of speech (transcribed by researcher): "Der Einwand es gabe keine Moglichkeit, die Juden aus dem deutsche Kunst, und Kulturleben zu beseitigen...ohne jede Reibung wurde die Richtung gewechselt...ist glanzend widerlegtworden...niemals zu ist der Kunstler in Deutschland so geehrt worden, nie jetzt..." [Translation: "[The earlier objection] that it was not possible to remove the Jews.... because there were so many of them....The Jews must be eliminated from art and culture."]
