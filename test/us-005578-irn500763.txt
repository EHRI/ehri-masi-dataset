Consists of a baptismal certificate for Sophia Balitzer, originally issued in 1935 and reissued in 1947; a marriage certificate, dated 1936 at the parish of Sw. Magdaleny in Grodno; a 1945 identity card with photograph issued to Regina Balitzer, originally of Radom; and a postcard sent from Z. Baltizer in the Tarnow ghetto to his sister, M. Adout, in Lausanne, Switzerland, dated 1942. The baptismal and marriage certificate were forged in attempts to aid the Balitzer family of Radom to survive the Holocaust. Includes a memoir dated 1994, written by Lea Balitzer Evron, the daughter of Regina and Z., who describes life in the Tarnow ghetto, various hiding situations in Warsaw, her memories of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, when she had to move and go into hiding near Krakow. Regina and Lea Balitzer survived the war, but her father (Z.) and sister perished.
