Japanese in South Pacific

Japanese ships battling Americans and English in the South Pacific. Shots of Japanese sailors preparing for battle, shoes running across the deck and up stairs of the ship, exciting music. Japanese planes taking off from the deck of an aircraft carrier; shots of planes in the air. Battle scenes from the Japanese ship's perspective, including guns firing and low-flying planes, with dramatic music and occasional comments by the narrator. A graphic illustrates the number of American vessels destroyed by the Japanese. "In the first eleven months of the war, the Japanese navy has destroyed seven warships, twelve aircraft carriers, seventeen cruisers, thirteen destroyers, six submarines."
