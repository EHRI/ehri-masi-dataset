Ruth Szmarag (b. 1935) was born in Vienna, Austria to Sigmond (Nussim Zelig) Szmarga (1896-1942) and Flora Blima Schindler (1901-1982). The family spoke German and had Socialist beliefs. In 1939, after Kristalnacht, Sigmond, Flora, Ruth, and Flora’s younger brother, Philippe fled Austria to Brussels, Belgium. Sigmond was arrested and sent to France where he was imprisoned in the Drancy internment camp. On August 19, 1942 Sigmond was sent to Auschwitz where he was killed. After Sigmund’s arrest, Flora and Ruth tried to join him in France, but did not succeed. In late 1941, Philippe rented a house for Ruth, Flora, and the Sinaiberger family including Hans, Steffi, and their son George. The Sinaiberger family lived on the third floor, Ruth and her mother lived on the second floor, and a non-Jewish couple lived on the first floor in order to provide protection. Philippe lived in a house close by. During her time in hiding Ruth wrote plays and acted them out with George and George's father taught Ruth how to read. They remained in hiding until after liberation. After the war Ruth attended school and later went to medical school. Ruth spent three years in Israel and later immigrated to the United States where she continued her work as a child psychiatrist.

The poems, plays, and diary were written by Ruth during her time in hiding.
