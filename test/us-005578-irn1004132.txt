Fasching [Carnival] parade with antisemitic float

Carnival in Munich. Shots of large crowds watching the parade. A group of men wearing wine barrels march down the street. One float shows a huge caricature of a man holding large letters spelling "Kolonien." Marching men hold letters spelling "KDF." Raucous carnival celebrations in Mannheim. Men on horseback hold signs reading "Ufa." Crowds cheer loudly and parade participants yell and play to the camera. One of the floats contains a caricature of a Jew brandishing a quill pen and wearing a Star of David on his chest. A sign on the float reads "Die Luegentante der Weltpresse." [The lying aunts of the world press].
