Az Ich Veis | Zemerl

Chayela Rosenthal (Khayele Rozental) (b. Vilna, 1924-d. Cape Town, 1979). A professional singer and actress before the war, Rosenthal was an early and active participant in the Vilna ghetto theater. Surviving the ghetto and several camps, she resumed her career in postwar Paris, and continued to entertain internationally (in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English) after settling in South Africa in 1951.
