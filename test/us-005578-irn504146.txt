Abraham Briansky's memoir describes how he: was deported from the Soviet Union because of a letter that he wrote and sent to Joseph Stalin; spent two years in Palestine; emigrated to France; fought in the French army during the German invasion; fled to southern France following the French capitulation; was captured by German soldiers after he tried to recover some property in Vichy France; and escaped and emigrated to the United States via Portugal. The photocopied letters relate to Briansky's attempts to get his memoir published.
