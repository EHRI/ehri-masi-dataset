The provenance of the original and this copy document is unknown.

This letter of the school inspector of Munich concerning the school-building of the Jewish community, written on the 12 of November 1938, to the government of Bavaria/Munich reports the destruction of the school-building caused by a fire in the attached Synagogue. Considering the date of the letter it can be assumed that the fire was a result of the pogroms on the 9 November 1939. Moreover, the school inspector reports that of six male teachers three are in prison, one is ill and that the whereabouts of the fifth teacher is unclear. Therefore he orders the closure of the school.
