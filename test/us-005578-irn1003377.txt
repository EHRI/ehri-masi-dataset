German Fighter Airplanes

German "Kampf und Jagd Flugzeuge" [combat and fighter airplanes] on a snow-covered airfield. German troops repair planes and shovel snow from the airfield, even as snow continues to fall. A German in a flight suit tries to warm himself by waving his arms and blowing on his hands. Men load bombs onto the planes. A large bomb is pulled on a sled across the field and then loaded onto a plane. The engines are warmed before takeoff, using a large tube shaped vent. Shots of different types of planes taking off and in the air. The pilot and copilot in the cockpit. Down below are dark tracks in the snow, made by tanks in battle. Bombs dropping on "Bolshevist" positions. Soviet planes appear and engage the Germans. Reel ends.
