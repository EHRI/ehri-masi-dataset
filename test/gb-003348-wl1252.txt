Kurt Ferber: personal papers

4 folders

Kurt Ferber was a resident of Berlin-Mariendorf. Judging from the company note paper that he used quite frequently, he was employed by an iron manufacturing business, based in Berlin, although in what capacity it is not known. He refers to his many years service with the '<i>Spionagepolizei</i>' (1252/1/8)- it is not clear what that was, or when and where his service took place. He also refers to his time as a member of the border police in Silesia (1252/13). With regard to his family, the only information which emerges is that he had a cousin, who had been living in inner China for 10 years as a missionary (1252/1/11).<br /><br />Olga Bruewitsch-Heuss, the other correspondent, was resident at the home of Major Runde, Berlin- Wilmersdorf Konstanzerstrasse 10 up until she moved to Bregenzerstrasse 15 flat 3 (1252/1/14, dated 22.10.1932) after a period of illness. The only information known about her family is that she had an uncle, General Giessler. Both correspondents were probably members of the <i>Kampfbund f端r deutsche Kultur</i>, since this organization is referred to in the correspondence and there is further material relating to it in the collection.<br /><br /><br />This spartan account of the identities of the two correspondents is contrasted by the often detailed insight into the mentalities of a self-professed nazi and a right-wing conservative. <i>Kampfbund f端r deutsche Kultur</i> was founded by Alfred Rosenberg on 19 December 1928 in Munich. The purpose of the league was to promote the beliefs of Hitler on the nature of German culture and to combat Jewish influence in German cultural life. In May 1933 it was recognized as the official cultural organization of the NSDAP.

This collection, comprises a set of correspondence between Kurt Ferber and a friend in Berlin; material relating to the <i>Kampfbund f端r deutsche Kultur</i>; miscellaneous contemporary newspapers and cuttings; and unidentified notes. The correspondence is of particular interest for it provides a fascinating insight into the mentalities of 2 ordinary German citizens with special reference to their political and cultural interests. The provenance of the material is not known. Nor is anything known about the history of its custody prior to deposit. Olga Bruewitsch-Heuss' political stance is made clear in her first letter (1252/1/1), where she regards the <i>Deutsche National Volkspartei</i> as too liberal. In the same letter she reveals her anti-Semitism and her views on racial doctrine: she expresses her objection to Jewish land speculators and considers it the most important duty to preserve the purity of German blood. Her anti-Semitism is a constant theme throughout the letters. Equally apparent is her devotion and respect for the nazi party and its leaders; which she repeatedly refers to as '<i>unsere Bewegung</i>'. At one point she admits that she wouldn't know how to live if she were not a nazi, it was like a religion to her (1252/1/14). In an earlier letter she describes how she was consumed with emotion at a nazi party rally at the <i>Sportpalast</i>; that [Georg] Strasser was a Titan; that even stone faced SA and SS men were driven to tears (1252/1/5). Her last epistle was written on the day that Hitler became Chancellor. She regrets being too ill to go out on the streets to celebrate and remarks (in relation to the speed with which all the newspapers were sold out) that the Jews are quick to capitalize on anything. Whilst her political views differ from those of Kurt Ferber, the tenor of the correspondence is one of respect and affection. They were clearly good friends and, on more than one occasion, arranged to meet up.<br /><br />Kurt Ferber is more critical of the nazis and Hitler. He reports a conversation between him and a friend, a former nazi troup leader, in which they agree that Hitler is generally not regarded as the ideal leader or saviour (1252/1/4). Similarly he regards Hitler as a failure as a diplomat and laments the lack of importance, which Hitler attaches to foreign policy (1252/1/6). He betrays an ambivalence towards the Jews. On the one hand he naively thinks that the Jewish press will somehow capitalize on the progress of the nazi party (1252/1/8). Later he is almost apologetic for his defence of the contributions Jews have made to German society (1252/1/11); resigning himself to the acceptance of a contradictory relationship, in which German nationalists are compelled to reject Jews, but German society must acknowledge the benefits they have brought particularly to the economy.<br /><br />The remaining material in the collection consists of papers relating to the <i>Kampfbund f端r deutsche Kultur</i> <br />(1252/2/1-7); Kurt Ferber's notes (1252/3/1-); and issues/ cuttings from contemporary German press (1252/4/1-8)
