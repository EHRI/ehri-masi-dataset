The file contains a report from 1937 about the position of Jews in the Prussian province of Pomerania before 1933 and in early 1937. The report has appeared in English, German and French and was published by the Jewish Central information Office, which published every month a new report always regarding the situation of Jews in Germany or other European countries. In 1928 Alfred Wiener was instrumental in creating the BÃ¼ro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). Jews in Pomerania played a quite important economic role before 1933, as owners of big businesses, big companies in grain trade, cattle dealer and others. Also small businesses belonged to several prestigious Jews. Since 1933 pressure was put on Jewish proprietors in order to force them to sell their businesses. Since 1933 till 1937 a decline of 60% to 70% of Jewish proprietors was visible. Further the exclusion of Jewish employees from business establishments went on. This applied in particular to banks and insurance companies. Also people who worked for the state were forbidden to patronize Jewish establishments or consult them, in addition customers were prevented from entering into Jewish premises. In 1929 7800 Jews were living in Pomerania, at the beginning of 1937 not more than 5000.
