Ada Feingold (1923-2012) was born in Warsaw to Chaim and Ethel Kołodzianska. She survived the Warsaw Ghetto, escaping just before the uprising. According to her USC Shoah Foundation Institute oral history interview, she adopted the false identity Christina Jedraska and survived the Ravensbrück concentration camp and forced labor at the Oranienburg-Heinkelwerke armaments factory. She immigrated to the United States in 1946 via Göteborg, Sweden, married Julian Feingold in 1949, and was naturalized as an American citizen in 1952.

The Ada Feingold papers include two drafts of her memoirs describing the Warsaw ghetto and uprising, correspondence with Ada’s mother in the United States, a photograph labeled “W-wa ghetto 1942 Ala I Alek Młynek (Skotnicki),” a list of surviving Jews in Warsaw as of June 5, 1945 compiled by the Central Jewish Committee in Poland, a 1945 Berlin train ticket, registration certificates documenting Ada’s postwar presence in Łódź, Warsaw, Białystok, and Göteborg and her petition for naturalization in the United States, acknowledgements documenting Ada’s efforts to receive restitution, and a book report Ada wrote about Silas Mariner for an English class.
