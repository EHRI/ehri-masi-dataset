United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Contains pre-war photographic images of the Weiner family (donor's immediate family) in Veľké Ripňany, Czechoslovakia (present day Slovakia); and pre-war photographs of the Flaschner family (donor’s husband’s immediate family) in Austria. Also included are post-war photos of Isabella Wiener at the Feldafing DP camp in Germany. The pre-war Weiner family photos were entrusted to non-Jewish neighbors by Malvina Weiner (donor's mother) right before her deportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942 where she perished; Isabella survived the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Płaszów concentration camps, returned home, then moved to Germany, and immigrated to Israel in 1948. She eventually immigrated to the United States.
