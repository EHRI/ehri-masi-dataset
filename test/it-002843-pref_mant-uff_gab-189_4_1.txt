On September 8th, 1960, the Italian Home Secretary (more specific, in Italian: Ministero dell’Interno, Direzione generale della pubblica sicurezza, divisione Affari riservati, sezione terza) issued a letter with formal recommendation for all the police authorities not to use the expression “of Jewish race” or “formerly known as of Jewish race” when referring to people of Jewish origin in official documents, making use of their racial files only to give them the benefits they deserved because of the persecution they suffered (according to the Italian law n° 96, issued in March 10th, 1955). There are copies of the letter for the questore (police superintendent) and for the chief commander of the Carabinieri in Mantua.
