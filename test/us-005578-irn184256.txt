Hildegard (Hilde) Vicktor (1909-2012) was born in Böchingen, Germany, just outside Landau, to wine merchant Eugene Kern (1877-1935) and his wife, Isabella (nee Michel, 1885-1950) from Edesheim. In 1933 Hilde married cattle dealer Karl Vicktor (1906-1975) from Spiesen. Their daughter Ruth was born in St. Ingbert in 1934. Hilde immigrated to the United States in 1936 with her husband, daughter, and mother-in-law (Klara Vicktor, 1878-1955) and settled in Brooklyn. Hilde’s mother joined them later that year.

The Hildegard Vicktor papers consist of family trees; correspondence tracing Hilde’s aunt Berthilde Kern Kohler; a history of the Jewish community of Landau in der Pfalz; photocopies of birth, marriage, and death certificates for Karl and Hilde Vicktor and Isabella Kern; two photographs of the Vicktor, Kern, and Michel families; an article about Kristallnacht in Landau; an article about Hilde’s cousin Werner Michel; memorial remarks by the mayor of Landau in 1987; and Hilde’s brief account of her return visits to Germany.
