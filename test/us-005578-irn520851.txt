Cross of Honor of the German Mother medal

The medal was acquired by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2001.

The Mother's Cross was instituted by the Nazi Party in 1938. It was first awarded in 1939 to some 3 million mothers as a propaganda measure to promote National Socialist population policy.
