Herbert Gutmann was born in 1899 to Adolf and Clara Gutmann in Autenhausen, Germany. He attended school until he was drafted for military duty in June, 1917. In World War I, he fought at the battles of Chat-Thierry, Argonne, Marne, and Verdun. He was wounded in September 1918 and hospitalized in Mainz, and was later discharged after the war had ended in December of that same year. Beginning in January of 1919, Herbert began working as a banking apprentice in Bamberg. He changed positions several times but continued his work in the banking industry, eventually managing the stock and foreign exchange department at a bank in Berlin. He served in this position until 1934, when political pressure began to be placed on companies with Jewish employees in management positions. Herbert voluntarily resigned, knowing he would be forced out soon. He moved to Coburg to assist his father in his cattle trading business. Herbert’s father passed away in October 1936, and Herbert moved to the United States in 1938. His visa was supported by Edgar Stern of New Orleans, a cousin of his mother Clara, who later immigrated to the United States as well. Herbert settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and from 1957-1965, sued the state of Bavaria for damages. Due to his Jewish faith, his father’s cattle trading license was revoked, and boycotts of the business began, resulting in the business’ failure. Herbert Gutmann died in August, 1973.
