Consists of a letter and envelope addressed to Sandor Kovacs [donor’s parents’ neighbor] in Nagy Kapos, Czechoslovakia [presently Veľké Kapušany, Slovakia] from Blanka Markovits (the donor’s mother) in Sweden, postmarked 17 July 1945. The author states that she is alive, recuperating in Sweden, having been brought there by the British government from Germany, and asks her neighbor to let her siblings, sons, and husband, upon their return, know of her whereabouts. Blanka Markovits died on 11 September 1945, in Sweden, as a result of her wartime experiences.
