Laura Varon was born in 1926 in Rhodes, Italy (currently Rhodes, Greece). In spring 1944 the Nazis occupied the island and her family was transported by ship to Athens and the Haidary concentration camp. From there they were deported to Auschwitz, where most of her relatives, including her parents, perished. Laura was later transferred to Dachau, and then sent on a death march to Bergen-Belsen, where she was liberated. After recuperating in Sweden, Laura settled in the Congo. In 1947 she was reunited with her uncle, two brothers, and her sister in Italy. In 1962 Laura immigrated to the United States and settled in Seattle, Washington.

The collection consists of four photographic prints and two photographic postcards. Four of the photographs are portraits and the remaining two show images of a woman with a child and a mother, father and baby.
