Forget-me-not flower pin of the type issued at the Annual Convent of the United Grand Lodge of Germany, A.F. and A.M., in 1948. It was issued to honor those members of the order who carried on their traditions despite censorship by the Nazi regime in Germany. The German Grand Lodge in Bayreuth adopted the wearing of a blue forget-me-not flower in the lapel as an unobtrusive mark of Masonic membership around 1934. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, they prohibited gatherings of the organization and Freemasons had to meet and conduct their activities in secret.
