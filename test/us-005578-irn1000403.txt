Begging; shops with food; children smuggling (staged)

Beggars by shop window full of food. Woman buys lavish sweets from vendor. VAR shots of stores full of goods. Boy tries to steal a loaf of bread and shop-owner swats at him with a stick, then looks into camera. Children break through and then come through hole in brick wall, smuggling food. Note: Ghetto diaries document the staging of these scenes.
