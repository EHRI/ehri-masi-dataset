Leningrad

Map showing Leningrad and Tichwin (Tikhvin). German soldiers dragging large artillery shells on a sled through the snow in a forested area. They load the shells into a howitzer and fire at a structure that looks like a factory. A fast-forward section which soldiers load guns, hit the ground, fire, then hop up and repeat the sequence. More shooting across the snowy landscape, including with a machine gun. A contingent of Waffen SS troops, clad in white snowsuits and helmets, advance on the Soviet position. German troops using flamethrowers in a nighttime firefight. Daytime again; more shooting, pan across dead Soviets in the snow.
