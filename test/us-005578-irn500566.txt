The Jules Barrash letter consists of a typed testimony, written as a letter to family, by Jules Barrash, a Jewish-American liberator of the Buchenwald concentration camp, April 16, 1945. In the testimony, he describes the camp physically, his impressions taking a tour from a newly liberated French prisoner, and the hospital before bringing the other soldiers in his outfit in for a tour. He wrote that what he saw at Buchenwald showed him the reason they were fighting the war.
