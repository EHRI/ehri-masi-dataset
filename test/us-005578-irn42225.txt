Charles Vogel (c.1883-1960) was a World War I veteran and a lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. His brother, Harry, and sister-in-law, Jean Vogel had two sons, Bernard (“Jack” 1924-1945) Vogel and Martin (1926-) Vogel. Bernard and Martin were in college at the beginning of the World War II. Bernard was drafted in 1944 and served with the 106th Infantry Division. He was deployed later that year. Martin enlisted in 1944 and served with the 372nd Engineers. During the Battle of the Bulge on 17 December 1944, Bernard was captured by German forces in Luxembourg and sent to Stalag IX B, a German prisoner-of-war camp, in Bad Orb, Germany. He was one of 350 American soldiers sent to the forced labor camp Berga an der Elster, a sub-camp of Buchenwald concentration camp where he was killed after attempting to escape. After Bernard’s family learned of his death, Charles worked pro bono to gather evidence about what occurred at Berga. In his attempts to build a case and generate support he corresponded with the State Department and the War Department. He also contacted Berga survivors and family members and asked them to fill out questionnaires and provide any useful information, such as testimonies. He passed along his finding to the War Crimes Branch of the United States War Department in hopes that his evidence would be used during the 1946 War Crimes trial of Erwin Metz and Ludwig Merz, Commanders of Berga, in Germany. Some of the material was used, but no survivors were asked to testify. After Metz and Merz’s sentences were reduced, Charles petitioned for President Truman, Defense Secretary James Forrestal, and Secretary of State George Marshall to call for a new trial. However, Metz and Merz were both free by 1955. Charles continued his search for answers and justice for the survivors and victims of Berga until he passed away in 1960.
