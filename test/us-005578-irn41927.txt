The Hyman Robert Levitan collection consists of documents, newspaper clippings and photographs related to Hyman Robert (Bob) Levitan, a World War II veteran, who became the captain of the SS Ben Hecht and illegally transported a group of refugees, mainly Holocaust survivors, to Palestine in 1947. The ship was intercepted by British warships and the passengers and crew were imprisoned. The crew was released after six months, while the refugees were eventually allowed into Palestine. The collection includes photographs taken on the ship and in prison, newspaper clippings, magazine clippings, and documents related to Bob Levitan and the SS Ben Hecht, which was financed by supporters of the Bergson group.
