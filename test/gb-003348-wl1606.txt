1 folder

The author, Mitzi was a close friend of the depositor's mother in Vienna, where they were both born before 1900. When the war began she, her husband, Lutz, and their daughter, Eva, were living in Budapest. After the war the family emigrated to Israel. The Schlesinger family had emigrated to Great Britain, but the two families remained in contact for 40 years.

This collection documents the experiences of a Jewish family in Vienna before and just after the Nazi occupation. This includes official correspondence which highlights the increasingly Anti-semitic measures taken by the authorities.<br /><br />The collection also contains a long letter from Jewish friends of the family, who managed to survive the war years in Hungary. This is a rare and valuable account of the Hungarian Jewish experience during the Nazi era, containing descriptions of life in hiding, deportations, massacres by Hungarian Nazis and life in Budapest in the immediate postwar years.
