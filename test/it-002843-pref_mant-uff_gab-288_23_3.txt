Anita Duranti, married Bassani, was a Jewish woman born in Ancona, Italy, on July 22nd, 1908. She had been working as a public employee in Rome since 1936, but, because of racial laws, she lost her job in 1941. To escape racial persecution, in 1943 she took refuge in the monastery of the Luxembourgian nuns in Rome. In 1968 she asked for an official certificate as racial persecuted in Mantua, as she had become a member of the local Jewish community.
