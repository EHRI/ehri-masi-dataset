Otto had one younger brother, Kurt (later Curt Rocker, 1921-2008), who was born on 11 May 1921 in Vienna. Otto was involved with a Zionist movement as a teenager, and went to England before WWII. He was sent to Canada aboard the SS Ettrick on 3 July 1940 as an “alien internee,” but returned to England on 19 October 1941. He worked in London as a tailor. After the war, he met fellow Viennese refugee Beate Goldfeld in 1945 and they married the same year. Their daughter Doreen was born in 1947, and their son Steven in 1949. Around 1948, they changed their last name from Rauchbach to Rocker. On 30 December 1953, the family immigrated to the United States aboard the SS Ryndam. They settled in Washington Heights in upper Manhattan where Otto worked as a tailor. Both Beate and Otto became naturalized citizens in 1959. Otto’s parents were both deported from Vienna to Maly Trostinec (near Minsk, Belarus) on 27 May 1942 where they perished. His younger brother Kurt survived the war in Holland through a series of ruses and false identities. In August 1942, he was to be deported to a camp, but enlisted a doctor to schedule him for a false surgery, delaying it. A Nazi doctor examined him and determined there was nothing wrong with him, so he fled the hospital.A nurse had given him the name of someone in Bilthoven who helped him go underground. Kurt had a Dutch identity card and worked as a traveling salesman selling perfume. In the spring of 1943, when Dutch young men (18-24) were required to work in Germany, Kurt went to Hamburg to work as a gardener. Four days after his arrival, the Allied bombing of the city commenced. When foreign workers were ordered to participate in the cleanup, Kurt fled, using the false German identity of Gert Furhmann. He joined the others evacuating from Hamburg and made his way to Vienna via Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin. Once he reached Vienna he stayed with his Aunt Dora, who was in hiding. He later returned to Holland and resumed his work as a traveling perfume salesman. On 18 October 1947 Kurt immigrated to the United States from Southampton, England aboard the Queen Mary. He also changed his name to Curt Rocker.
