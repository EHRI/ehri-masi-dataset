Kiev church service

The Kiev-Pechersk Monastery at sunset (the campanile is clearly visible), and then the cupolas of what appears to be the Cathedral of Dormition (within the monastery). Night-time exterior of Saint Andrew's Church (not at the monastery), followed by interior shots of an Orthodox mass. The choir is singing, and the worshippers stand listening, crowded beneath the iconostasis. Translation of Russian narration: On the occasion of Easter the German high command in Kiev ordered to convey restored Orthodox churches to the Ukrainian people. The people responded to the restoration of their religious life with thanksgiving services.
