Heinz “Henry” Salomon (1908-1992) was born in Werne, Germany to Siegmund and Rosa Salomon. His family owned and operated a butcher store, until the Kristallnacht occurred and the town began to slowly turn against them. During a raid in 1939, Henry was rounded up along with other Jews in the town, to be sent away. He resisted, however, and was beaten and left for dead in the town square. An ambulance rescued him, and he recovered in a Catholic hospital. Once his health improved, he was sent to a Catholic monastery, which assisted Henry in gathering the necessary papers to leave Germany. He acquired a visa to Australia, but traveled to England instead, to join with Grete Nathan, who he had met before being arrested. In mid-1939, Henry arrived in England, where he was arrested under suspicions of being a spy and set to the Lord Kitchener camp. Rather than wait in the camp, Henry decided to enlist in the British Army, and also married Grete Nathan. He served with the army from 1939-1944, often on the front lines. He was discharged after becoming wounded from a grenade explosion. After leaving the military, Henry moved to Oxford with Grete and worked as a manager for a meat market. In 1948, the family moved to the United States.

Grete Nathan Salomon (1908-1981) was born in Kamen, Germany to Phillip and Josephine Nathan. She had two sisters, both of whom fled the country when Hitler came to power. Grete worked as a seamstress, and decided to stay with her parents. She stayed until 1939, when it became impossible for her to find work. She decided to leave for England, where she worked doing odd jobs and attempted to get her parents out of Germany. While in England, she married Henry Salomon, who immigrated there to be with her, and their son Ronald was born in 1941, while Henry fought in the war. In the meantime, her father was sent to a concentration camp and killed, while her mother died of illness. In 1948, the family moved to the United States.
