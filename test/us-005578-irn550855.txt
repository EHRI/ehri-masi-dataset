Horia Stamatu (1912-1989), a Romanian author and poet, was born on September 9, 1912 in Vǎlanii de Munte, Romania. He worked as a substitute teacher at Cantemir Vodǎ High School in Bucharest. From 1938 to 1940, he served as an editor of the Enciclopedia Romaniei. He became a member of the Iron Guard and participated in the Legionnaires’ rebellion in Bucharest which took place on January 21-23, 1941. The rebellion coincided with the violent Bucharest pogrom. Following the rebellion and pogrom, Stamatu fled Bucharest for Germany, traveling through Bulgaria. From 1942-1944 he was imprisoned at the Buchenwald concentration camp and was sentenced to death in absentia by a Romanian military tribunal. The sentence was never fulfilled. Stamatu was eventually released from Buchenwald. In 1945, he studied philosophy with Max Müller at the University of Freiburg and held lectures in linguistics focusing on Romanian. Horia Stamatu lived in Paris, France from 1948-1950, where he helped found a Romanian research institute.
