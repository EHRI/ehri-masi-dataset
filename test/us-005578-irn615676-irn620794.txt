I'm An American -- Walter Damrosch

On December 23, 1940 Walter Damrosch discussed with Alexander Holtzoff, Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice, how music complements democracy. The famed conductor shares with listeners his family’s immigration story. Damrosch claims music is an universal language that can create a brotherhood. He uses Christmas music as an example of uplifting the spirits of people in war-torn countries. Holzoff refers to America as “a composite of nations.” Damrosch agrees and mentions many different Christmas songs can be heard across the country in various languages. The composer states his music is democratic because he plays for everyone regardless of class. He states the radio was the greatest invention for democracy because of its ability to reach people in far lands. Damrosch tells Holtzoff that he wants to teach people that they can work together, like an orchestra. Walter Damrosch (b. Walter Johannes Damrosch) was born January 30, 1862 in Breslau (now Wroclaw), Poland to a prestigious musical family. His father, Leopold Damrosch, was a distinguished German composer and conductor who began training his sons at an early age in music. Damrosch immigrated to New York with his family when he was 9. He continued his musical training under his father. In 1884, he was appointed Assistant Conductor for the all-German season at the Metropolitan Opera by his father. Damrosch made his opera debut at 22 in February 1885. After his father’s death, the musician assumed conductorship of his father’s founded musical societies and orchestras (the New York Symphony Society, the Ontario Society of New York, and the Metropolitan Opera Company). Damrosch founded the Damrosch Opera Company in 1894, which became of the Metropolitan Opera Company’s biggest rival. He served as musical consultant for NBC and produced a music appreciation radio series for children from 1924 to 1942. The Library of Congress credits Walter Damrosch with promoting and disseminating American music.
