Albumas su priklijuotais Hermano Kruko dienoraščio puslapiais, 1941-1943

Album, 27 pages with fragments of paper pieces

The three copies of the Ghetto Chronicle were hidden by Kruk in different places. One was given to a Polish priest who was believed to have been murdered by the Germans. One remained in the library and the third he buried in a metal container. In months of labor after the liberation of the liquidated ghetto by the Soviet Union, the poet Abraham Sutzkever was able to collect the individual pages from the opened container and bring them to safety in Moscow. A complete publication of all pages found in the chronicle and diary of Herman Kruk is available in English. Some of the records from outside the ghetto have been lost. Only fragments have survived. 
These notes were kept in the post-war Vilnius Jewish Museum from 1944 to 1949, and after its closure, they were transferred to the Central State Archive of Lithuania (LCVA FR 1390 ap. 1 b. 58-73). In 1998, the documents were returned to the Vilna Gaon State Jewish Museum.
