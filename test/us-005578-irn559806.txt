Papers, documents, and correspondence illustrating the experiences of Rose Reichman Katz's (donor's mother) extended family in Raslavice, Slovakia before, during, and after the Holocaust.

Documents indicate Rose's siblings were deported in 1942 to the Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center in Poland where they are presumed to have perished.
