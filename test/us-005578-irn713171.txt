Agi Geva was born Agnes Laszlo on June 2, 1930, in Budapest, Hungary to Rozsa (Rosalia, 1902-2000) and Zoltan Laszlo (d. 1944). For her first six years, Agi and her family lived on a farm called Pogony-Puszta, where her father was the farm manager. They moved to Miskolc when he became ill. His death coincided with the Germany occupation of Hungary on March 19, 1944. Agi, her sister Zsuzsanna, and their mother Rozsa were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and managed to remain together throughout many selections. Several weeks after arriving at Auschwitz, they were transferred to the Płaszów concentration camp, where conditions became worse. When Płaszów was liquidated, the SS authorities transported them back to Auschwitz. A short time later, the camp authorities selected them, along with 180 Hungarian and 20 Polish women, for transport to a subcamp of Flossenbürg in Rochlitz, Germany, where they were trained to work at a factory that manufactured spare parts for airplanes. Then they were transferred to a factory in Calw, a subcamp of Natzweiler-Struthof for several months before being evacuated on a death march. American troops liberated them from their march on April 28, 1945. Agi, her mother, and her sister remained in Innsbruck, Austria for eight months before returning to Hungary. In 1949 Agi and Zsuzsanna immigrated to Israel, where they each got married. Zsuzsanna’s husband was a fellow survivor. Agi had two children. Zsuzsanna had three children and went to live in Kibbutz Haogen, where she still lives today. Their mother Rozsa immigrated to Israel in 1956 with her second husband, Dr. Gyula Sugár (b. 1899), who had survived multiple labor and concentration camps including Mauthausen and Gunskirchen. Rozsa remained in Israel until her death at the age of 98. She is survived by her two daughters, five grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren. After living in Israel for 53 years, Agi came to the United States to live with her daughter. She has volunteered at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum since 2002.
