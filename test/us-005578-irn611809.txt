John Vincent Tillman (1907-1956) was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Catholic parents, Herman and Una Tillman. From October 1935 through summer 1936, he was on a fellowship at the University of Munich studying German opera. Tillman travelled across Germany during this time. He recorded his travels on 16mm film and kept a diary of his experiences. Tillman later received a doctorate from the University of Chicago and chaired the German department of St. Louis University. He and his wife Esther (1911-2007) had five children.

The John Vincent Tillman papers include his diary and manuscript describing his travels in Germany in 1935 and 1936, a photograph of him, and pamphlets from the “Schaffendes Volk” exhibition in Düsseldorf.
