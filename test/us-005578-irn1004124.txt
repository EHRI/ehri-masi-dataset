Jews in occupied Poland

Camera pans across a damaged brick building to a synagogue while the narrator says that the synagogue is the only building that has not been destroyed by the arsonists, and "further commentary is superfluous." Shots of the exterior and interior of the synagogue. Several close-up shots of Jews. The narrator says that in the ghettos of the occupied territories the eastern Jews are in the best mood. More shots of smiling men, women and children as the narrator asserts that these scenes should refute the foreign atrocity propaganda. The camera pans across a large crowd of Jewish men and boys sitting on the ground. They are described as insubordinate elements. Close-ups of faces, then shots of Jews, some religious, at forced labor cleaning up rubble and digging a channel of some kind. The narrator says that for the first time in their lives they are forced to work.
