Anti-Jewish propaganda film: migration of Jews

A propaganda film declared as a "documentary film contribution about the problem of world Judaism," in which antisemitic stereotypes are disseminated by the Nazis, including scenes showing: Poland as a nesting place for Judaism; the comparison of Jews with rats; the difference between Jews and Aryans; "international crime"; "financial Judaism"; "assimilated Jews"; the Jewish influence on economics, culture, and politics; and Jewish religious practice with a portrayal of haggling and misused sacred Jewish texts. REEL 2 Further scenes shot in Warsaw, Poland, October 1939. More shots of Jewish street vendors followed by a montage of creative and physical work (production) done by "Aryans" contrasted with a brief shot of a Jewish man counting money. Exterior views of small shops, (shop signs "Leon Borgenicht", "Owoce Markus Goldfinger", ".... Schleichkorn", ".... Szmuel Zylberklang") and of large houses and luxurious villas. Montage of shots of goods and agricultural production with the narration: "Things which are valued by the creative Aryan peoples have been reduced by the Jew to the level of a mere piece of merchandise, which he buys and sells but cannot produce himself. The Jews are a people without farmers and workers, a parasitic people. So is it in Poland, so was it in Germany." The film then deals with the migration of the Jews. The narrator explains that the Jew is always wandering, that there is no difference between the Jew in Poland and the Jew in Palestine. A view through an archway in the Warsaw Ghetto cuts to a similar view through an archway and other street scenes in Jerusalem and shots of the Wailing Wall. [Moller notes that the Palestine footage comes from a 1934 Zionist film titled "Promised Land" that contrasts the orthodox Jewish way of life with modern, agrarian Zionism. The somewhat negative portrayal from the Zionist film is co-opted and made much stronger]. Narrator: "However, their homelessness is self-chosen." An animated map charts the Jewish migrations from Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Spain, France, England, Germany, Poland, Russia, Asia, Africa and America. Commentary: "The ultimate mongrelized Jew from the oriental Near Eastern race with Negroid admixture - differing from us Europeans, coming as we do from quite different racial elements, in body and above all in soul". Close-ups of several Jewish men. Further illustrations on the map show the Jews' wanderings to Europe, starting with the "cosmopolitan world-reach of Alexander the Great", through the 19th century with its "muddled ideas of human equality and freedom, which gave the Jews a powerful impetus." During the 19th and 20th centuries the Jews spread throughout Europe and the world.
