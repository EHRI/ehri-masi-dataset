The poster was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

One-sheet poster for the film, “Open Secret,” released on February 14, 1948. The film follows a newlywed couple as they work to figure out what happened to their friend, who goes missing just before they arrive for a visit. They discover that he attempted to infiltrate an antisemitic ring of thugs, and become embroiled themselves trying to bring the gang to justice. The low budget B-film, “Open Secret,” was poorly received, and panned as a subpar knockoff to films like “Crossfire” and “Gentleman’s Agreement.” Unlike the other films, however, “Open Secret” depicts post-war antisemitism from a working-class perspective. It was also the first to show a Jewish character physically fighting back against his aggressors. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
