575 frames

According to a letter at the beginning of the collection, the first part of the collection came via a Jewish lawyer involved in the prosecution of Boris Toedtli, one of the most important <i>Weltdienst</i> men in Switzerland, who was tried for espionage. It is believed that one of the prosecuting lawyers obtained the documentation and subsequently handed it to JUNA, the Jewish press agency of the Swiss Jewish Community. The provenance of the second part is unknown.

August Schirmer, who, having already been employed at <em>Weltdienst</em> in the 'American Section', took over publication of the periodical in July 1939. Shortly afterwards he announced the relocation of the offices to Frankfurt am Main, where all anti Jewish 'research establishments' under Alfred Rosenberg's direction were concentrated. Schirmer resigned in August 1943, at which time <em>Weltdienst</em> was published in 18 languages.</p><p><em>Weltdienst</em> continued well into 1944. Kurt Richter, the new publisher, was also director of an 'International Institute for the Enlightenment of the Jewish Question', also called <em>Weltdienst</em>. This institute organised gatherings of European antisemites "with a view to securing an exchange of ideas and experiences designed to steadily strengthen the common European defence action against Jewry".</p><p>In 1934 <em>Weltdienst</em> was given the task of rounding up Russian émigré experts to defend the veracity of the <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, at Bern. This anti-Semitic forgery came under public scrutiny in June 1933, when a right wing Swiss nationalist organisation known as the National Front began distributing it during a demonstration in Bern. A group of leading Swiss Jews filed a suit against the distributors, contending that the document, which described a Jewish plot to take over the world, fell under the ban on 'indecent writings'.</p>
