Simon Drucker was born in Paris in 1924 to Abraham and Thérèse Drucker. His father was deported to Auschwitz in June 1942 and killed there. He was arrested with his mother and brother during the Vel d’Hiv roundup and transferred to Beaune-la-Rolande. His mother and brother were both deported from Drancy to Auschwitz and killed. Drucker passed through a variety of prisons and concentration camps, occasionally escaping only to be re-arrested. He was selected for work at Auschwitz, evacuated by death march, and was liberated in May 1945. He spent the years from 1948 to 1952 fighting in Israel, but returned to Paris to re-establish his life.

The Simon Drucker memoir consist of a single typed page relating Drucker’s arrest during the Velodrome d’Hiver roundup; his internment, escape, and re-internment in nearly a dozen prisons and concentration camps in France, Poland, and Germany; liberation; fighting in the first Arab-Israeli war; and beginning his life again in Paris.
