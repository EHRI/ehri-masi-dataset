In June 1945 Alina Rindler and her sisters were liberated from Bergen Belsen. They learned that one of the sister's husbands was at Buchenwald. They set out for Buchenwald along with other women survivors. At the American zone of occupation, an American officer issued this document so they could be transported in U.S. Army vehicles. The handwritten note requests authorization for travel for six Polish Jewish women to GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. It was issued by Lewis M. Simon, Displaced Persons Officer, and addressed to Capt. Doyle.
