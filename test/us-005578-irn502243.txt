International Committee of the Red Cross

Series B SEC DAS pertains to the institutional and administrative history of the International Committee of the Red Cross. It concerns relief provided to civilians of all nationalities imprisoned or deported by the Nazi regime during the Second World War. Viewed from this angle, the archives of the DAS can inform the public of the significance of the humanitarian actions implemented under difficult political circumstances and aimed at people completely deprived of judicial and ethical protection. Series B SEC DAS includes general files, accounting and administrative records, receipt acknowledgements from civilians who received packages from the CIRC as well as files relating to the sending of individual and collective relief to civilians of all nationalities detained in Germany and the occupied territories. Includes records related to the Service Watson program, which used machines provided by the International Business Machines (IBM) corporation to quantify and track receipt cards for food packages received by prisoners.
