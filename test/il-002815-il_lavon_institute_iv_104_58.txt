This fonds contains several relevant files. We firstly note the correspondence of Zerubavel, in which we also find (copies of) letters (and sometimes circulars) of the Belgian section of Ahdut Haâ€™Avodah and of various correspondents in Belgium. See the files nr. 30, 33A, 33B, 34 and 60. They resp. cover the years 1922-1961, 1933-1962 and 1957-1962. Lastly, file nr. 29 contains, among others, documents related to the conference of Poale Zion held in August 1946 in Brussels.
