Gladys Grantz was born Gizela Kirscher (later Grantzova) on September 16, 1914 in Czechoslovakia. Gladys had three siblings Karol, Andor, and Zoltan. Karol Kirscher joined either the British Army or Navy before the Nazis rise to power. Gladys’ father, Jacob (Yaakov) Kirscher owned a lumberyard in Hungary. At some point, he burnt down the lumberyard and was killed by the Nazis as a result. Andor and Zoltan joined the Hungarian underground resistance. All three of Gladys’ siblings survived the war and immigrated to Israel. In 1938 Gladys married Meyer Grantz (her cousin) and later that same year she joined him in the United States. They had two children, Linda E. Roberts (née Grantz, b. July 5, 1939) and Carl Grantz (b. July 10, 1942).
