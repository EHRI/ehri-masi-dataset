Trude Grünwald was born in Vienna in 1922. In July 1938 her parents had obtained the documents required to emigrate. Arriving in Rogaska Slatina in Slovenia they met a relative who took them by car to Zagreb. After a short stay the family went to Durazzo (Dürres), Albania. They arrived at the end of November 1938. Trude tried to earn some money teaching German, French and mathematics. In January/February 1939 Trude and her mother obtained their visas to emigrate to England but they were still waiting for Trude's father's visa. The family struggled to survive during the battles with the Italian army in Durazzo. The Grünwalds managed to emigrate to England in July 1939.
