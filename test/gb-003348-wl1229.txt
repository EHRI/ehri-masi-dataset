Helga Lewin (née Krebs) was born in 1916 in Berlin of Jewish parents. From the age of 6 she took private piano lessons and it became apparent early on that she was very talented. She went on to study the piano more intensively, later becoming a piano teacher from 1937 to 1939. She fled Nazi Germany in April 1939 to England where she worked as a servant until she was interned as a German citizen in June 1940. After her release she worked as waitress in a café in Manchester. In 1946 she began work as a accordion player but had to give this up on account of the pain it was causing her back.<br/><br/>During the course of the next few decades she was awarded compensation for loss of potential earnings from the <i>Entschädigungsamt</i> (1229/16-17), but failed in her attempts to claim compensation for physical disability and mental illness.<br/><br/>

The papers in this collection document the attempts made by Helga Lewin to gain compensation for suffering caused by the Nazi regime. They include settlements and decisions made by the <i> Entschädigungsamt</i>, Berlin and the Berlin district court along with affidavits and numerous expert witness statements.
