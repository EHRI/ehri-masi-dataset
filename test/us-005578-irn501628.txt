The Irma Gideon collection consists of a handwritten memoir in German by Irma Gideon. The memoir described her experiences during Kristallnacht in Oberlustadt, Pfalz, Germany, 1938 and her emigration to the United States. The collection also includes a photocopy of a newspaper article titled "Lustadter Synagogenbrand vor dem Richter" and a copy of a trial in the Strafkammer des Landgerichts Landau in der Pfalz in April 1948, of those people responsible for the violence on Kristallnacht. There are also biographical notes regarding the Gideon family written in English, likely created by museum staff.
