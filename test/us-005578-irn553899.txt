Silent film star marries in synagogue

Magyar Híradó 62. Gitta Alpár and her fiancee stand in front of a synagogue, with crowds of people to the right and left. Gitta clutches a white coat around her and dons a crown-like headpiece. They walk down the stairs, and Gitta shakes a few people’s hands. Her husband tips his hat. Behind them is a young flower girl, carrying a bouquet. A man to Gitta’s right hands her a bouquet of flowers. CU of the newly married couple. Gita in a carriage, smiling. Her husband joins her, and the carriage pulls away. Another man and woman dressed in furs and sitting in a carriage, likely members of the wedding party. The crowd on the steps outside the synagogue, with another man and woman standing together in the foreground.
