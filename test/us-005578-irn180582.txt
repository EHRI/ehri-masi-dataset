Solomon Bergstein was born in 1901 to Mayer and Etie Bergstein. He attended school at the University of Vienna, where he studied pharmacology. He graduated in 1929 and worked for the Apotheke Grünberg & Metall pharmacy. In 1932, he married Lily Porter. As the situation worsened in Europe, the Bergsteins were desperate to leave. Unable to obtain a visa for the United States, the couple, accompanied by Lily’s mother Henrietta, traveled to Shanghai China in 1939 with little money. Once Solomon arrived, he met with other refugees and learned of the need for medical care for the thousands of refugees that were now residing in Shanghai. A medical board and hospital was formed, and Solomon was charged with the administration of the pharmacy. In the meantime, Lily worked as a seamstress in a textile factory. The Bergstein family eventually received their visas to immigrate to the United States in 1940. Solomon passed away in 1992.
