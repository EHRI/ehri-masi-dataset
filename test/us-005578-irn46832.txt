One typescript memoir, with five unattributed woodcuts, documenting the author's experiences as a would-be emigrant from Czechoslovakia to Palestine in 1940. The ship he was traveling on, the Atlantic, was seized by British authorities and the author and other passengers were interned on the island of Mauritius until 1945. The memoir, written in 1941-1942, documents this experience. Also included is a separate, handmade booklet containing seven pen-and-ink drawings of shipboard life and internment, by Fritz Haendel and another unidentified artist.
