Kalman Linkimer (1913-1988) was born in Latvia and worked as a teacher. In 1942, Kalman was taken to the Liepāja ghetto and sent to work on a base in Paplaka, Latvia. In 1944 he escaped the ghetto with Aaron Westermann and Zelig Hirschberg. Kalman’s friend, David Zivcon, told him about Robert Seduls (1906-1945) and his wife Johanna “Anna” Seduls (1910-1987) hiding people in their cellar. The three men decided to go to Seduls’ home. Kalman hid in the cellar for twelve months with seven men and three women. During this time, Kalman kept his diary from 1944-1945. The diary includes descriptions of their daily routine and experiences, such as a warning light that was used to alert them someone was coming and a radio they listened to for information on the war, as well as the physical and psychological challenges of hiding in the cellar. After Robert was killed in March 1945 from a bombing, Anna continued to care for them until the end of the war. After the war, Kalman moved to Riga, Latvia. Robert and Johanna Seduls were named Righteous Among the Nations in 1981.

The Kalman Linkimer diary was kept by Kalman Linkimer from 1944-1945 while in hiding with ten other Jews in the cellar of Robert and Johanna Seduls’ home in Liepāja, Latvia. Kalman began his diary in 1941, but he had to leave it behind when he escaped from the Liepāja ghetto. After he went into hiding at the Seduls’ home, he began a second diary from 1944-1945 and recounts his experiences recorded in his first diary as well as his daily routine and experiences. His last entry is dated 20 February 1945.
