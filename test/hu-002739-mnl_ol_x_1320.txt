A náci és nyilas rémtettek kivizsgálására alakult bizottság

The documentation of the Holocaust (avant la lettre) started in Hungary practically as soon as the war had ended and it took various major forms. Holocaust survivors played major roles in several of the attempts at early documentation such as the DEGOB interview project with thousands of camp survivors. The many trials that dealt with crimes committed against Hungarian Jews during the war years and the documentation project pursued by the Committee for the Investigation of Nazi and Arrow Cross Atrocities were among the most important Hungarian state-based forms of Holocaust documentation. Within days of the liberation of Budapest, the National Committee of Budapest decided to establish a Committee for the Investigation of Nazi and Arrow Cross Atrocities with the aim of making these horrible recent atrocities known as widely as possible. The Committee was to create around twelve thousand files based on the accounts of survivors of persecution and other eyewitnesses. The Committee was also responsible for several other tasks such as the exhumation of victims in unmarked mass graves and providing them with decent burials. These also contributed to its project of investigation and documentation.
