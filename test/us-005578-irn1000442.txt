Soviet POWs rounded up

German soldiers search farm. Bedraggled old man comes out of little hut; mustached man is frisked by soldier; soldier pokes/searches in leafy bush with his bayoneted rifle. Dappled sun. MS wounded POWs slowly make their way across field under guard, arm in arm, some being carried, some dragged. Most are wounded, hands up in surrender. All are in some kind of disarray in the field: chaos, fatigue, despair. Very dusty and dry.
