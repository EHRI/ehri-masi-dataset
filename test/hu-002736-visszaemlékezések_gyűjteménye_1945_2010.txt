Visszaemlékezések gyűjteménye (1945-2010)

ca. 850 files, 4 linear metres

The collection of testimonies is partly based on the material collected by the Hungarian Auschwitz Foundation (HFA), an NGO established by survivors in 1990 to collect and preserve documentation pertaining to the Holocaust as well as by other organizations including the Committee of the Persecutees of Nazism (Nüb) and the National Organization of Labor Servicemen (MUOSZ). The collection was handed over to the newly established Holocaust Memorial Center in 2004. From that time on, hundreds of individuals provided the HMC with their testimonies.

The HMC’s collection of testimonies mostly contains private files, with the exception of the Protocols of the National Committee Attending Deportees (DEGOB)

The collection includes about 850 handwritten or typed testimonies, mostly from the years between the early 1960s and the late 1980s. The size of the testimonies varies between one page to hundreds of pages. Most of them focus on the years of persecution between 1938 and 1945, with special emphasis on the concentration camps and labor service units. However, they also contain valuable information on the pre-war history of the Hungarian Jewish communities and reflections on their post-war fate.
