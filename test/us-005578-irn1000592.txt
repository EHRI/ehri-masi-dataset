Exhumation at hospital

Sign: Maros Utca 16 (address). Sign: X-ray. Exhumation by hospital. VO: Infamous hospital where the Arrow Cross committed murders. Mass graves exhumed in hospital garden. They killed helpless patients in their beds along with doctors and nurses. Former Arrow Cross members (waiting for trials) watch exhumation. CUs intercut with exhumation shots.
