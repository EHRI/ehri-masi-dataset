The District Office in Poprad was seated first in Spišská Sobota was subordinated to the County Office in Košice in the years 1923- 1928 and the Ministry of Interior. After the 1928 reform of state administration in Czechoslovakia resulted in the repeal of counties and County Offices, district offices in the Slovak territory were subordinated to the Country Office in Bratislava (Krajinský úrad v Bratislave). From 1932 the seat of the office was transferred to Poprad.
