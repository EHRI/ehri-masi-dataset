[Actions of governmental and privat organizations in regard to refugees]

1 electronic resource (109 pages)

The file contains correspondences between privat and governmental organizations in regard to refugees. Memoranda, reports, letters and plans of action can be seen. The principle of these organization is to protect the human victims of great political upheavals and especially of the intolerance of arbitrary governments. The 'League of Nation Union', for example, published an aide-mémoire concerning the problem of the refugees. Topics mentioned in the aide-mémoire are the coordination and cooperation to assist the German and Austrian refugees, as well as refugees from Czechoslovakia. Weather the problem of the refugees will be considered from an humanitarian, a political or an economic standpoint, it can not be denied that is an international problem. Only international action, so they argue, can solve the problem and help thousands of people. Moreover the international authorities in cooperation with the governments concerned should investigate land suitable for settlement in various parts in the world. Further plans should be made to simplify the life of the refugees in the emigration country. The accommodation in some countries has been gravly complicated by the fact that so many refugees came, also as a result of the Nuremberg racial laws.
