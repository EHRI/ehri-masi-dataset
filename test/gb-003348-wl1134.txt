Correspondence between the Duke of Buccleuch and Nathan Laski, in which Laski refutes a number of popular myths such as rich Jews flaunted their wealth; the majority of poor Jews were communist agitators; Jews dominated the British press; Jewish professionals and retailers remained popular amongst Germans even after the imposition of restrictions. Ultimately he seems to concur with the conciliatory approach recommended by Buccleuch as evidenced by the final sentence: “...I opposed the resolution [attacking Chamberlain's policy] and urged that no effort should be spared to come to an agreement both with Germany and Italy.”<br />English&nbsp;
