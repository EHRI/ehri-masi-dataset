Lisbeth Modley Kornreich (born Lisbeth Modley, 1913-1999) was born on 14 May 1913 in Vienna, Austria to Wilhelm and Augusta Modley. Wilhelm (later William, 1888-1977) was born on 4 October 1888 in Eisenstadt, Austria to Yakov (1840-1905) and Ida Modley. He had six siblings: Emil, Paula (1871-1918), Olga (later Olga Modley Bellack), Alfred (b. 1869), Felix, and Clara. Augusta (née Lipiner, 1891-1961?) was born on 29 March 1891. She had two sisters: Martha (later Martha Linder, b. 1890) and Nellie (later Nellie Zehetner, b. 1893). The Modley family lived in Vienna. They were a non-observant and upper-middle class. Wilhelm worked for an electronics and radio business under A. J. Kreminezky and then started his own incandescent light factory. Augusta worked as a seamstress and fashion designer. Augusta and Wilhelm divorced sometime in the 1930s. After the German-annexation of Austria in March 1938, Wilhelm was arrested. After his release on 18 August 1939 he fled to London. Augusta and Lisbeth had planned to leave Vienna on 6 September 1939, but were unable to after the Germans invaded Poland. William immigrated to the United States on the RMS Scythia and arrived in New York on 4 March 1940. Augusta supported herself and Lisbeth in Vienna with her seamstress work until they were able to leave Austria on 22 May 1941. They went to Lisbon, Portugal and sailed from there on the SS Mouzinho to the United States. They arrived in New York on 21 June 1941, but were briefly detained at Ellis Island likely due to Augusta and Wilhelm’s prior divorce. They agreed to remarry soon after being reunited. Lisbeth married Stephen Kornreich in 1943 and they had two daughters.
