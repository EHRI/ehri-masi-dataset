Beth and Lou Jacoby photograph collection

folder

1

Collection consists of four photographs depicting life in the ghetto during the Holocaust. The image of the boy and man fighting over a piece of bread was taken in the Warsaw ghetto. It is believed that the other three images (two of children standing in the street and another of someone laying on the sidewalk) were also taken in the Warsaw ghetto. Lou Jacoby's father's friend Janek Celnick survived the war as a photographer and gave these to the donor's father while they were living in the Neu Freimann DP camp.
