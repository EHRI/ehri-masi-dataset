The Central Historical Commission (CHC) of the Central Committee of Liberated Jews in Munich distributed questionnaires among the regional and municipal authorities, mainly in the American Occupied Zone in Germany. The purpose of these questionnaires was to gather information regarding the number of Jews living in various places in 1933 and during the Nazi period, as well as the number of Jews who perished. The questionnaires also contain questions regarding Nazi concentration camps in those areas.
