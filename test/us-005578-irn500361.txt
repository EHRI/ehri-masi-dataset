Leo Metzl is the son of Regina Metzl (née Reiss). He married Josephine “Fini” Fleischner, daughter of Martha Fleischner. In July 1935 the couple had a daughter, Alenka Klara Metzlova. In 1942, the Metzl family was living in Prague, Czech Republic where Alenka was attending school and Josephine was hospitalized and fighting terminal cancer. Josephine later died from her illness in Prague. Leo and Alenka were transported to a camp in Eastern Europe, where they perished.

The Metzl family papers consists almost entirely of correspondence written to Leo and Josephine Metzlova from members of Josephine’s family in 1942. The majority of the letters are from Josephine’s mother, Martha Fleischner. Three letters in this collection are written by Fini to Leo and her parents. Other correspondents include the couple’s young daughter, Alenka and Fini’s aunt, Josephine Orlik. Also comprised is a school report card for Alenka, and identification cards issued to Fini, one of which entitled her to free public transportation in the city of Prague due to her illness. All of the letters in this collection document the extended family’s preparations for their transport from Pardubice, Czech Republic to Theresienstadt during late November and early December 1942. Letters from Martha report her and her husband’s deportation instructions and transport numbers as she receives them from authorities. Her correspondence further describes the process of packing and shipping their belongings and cooking food to take with them on the transport. In each letter, she describes the family’s emotional state as they prepare for departure. The letter from Josephine Orlik, written on the eve of her deportation, serves as a farewell to the Metzl family and includes her transport numbers and instructions as well.
