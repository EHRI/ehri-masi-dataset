Nacha Frankel (later Nacha Krieger, 1919-1999) was born in Łódź, Poland. Her father was in the textiles business, and she had 9 brothers and sisters, including her brother Shlomo Frankel (later Shlomo Frank; 1902-1966). During the war, she was in the Łódź ghetto until it was liquidated in June 1944. She was then sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. When Auschwitz was liquidated in January 1945, she was sent on a forced march toward Germany. She was shot and left for dead, but survived thanks to a villager that found her and treated her wounds. After the war was over, Nacha went back to Łódź, where she was reunited with an old friend, Benjamin Krieger. They married, and then went to the Marktredwitz displaced persons camp in Bavaria. After their first daughter was born, they immigrated to Israel, and later moved to the United States. Nacha's brother Shlomo was a journalist before the war. During the war he was also in the Łódź ghetto, where he kept a diary. After the war, he moved to Israel, and published the diary as "Diary of the Łódź Ghetto" in1958.

Benjamin Zion Krieger (1912-1987) was the son of Zolman and Rachel Krieger and grew up in Łódź, Poland. He had at least 5 siblings, including Ben, Shifra, and Yuma Krieger. He was married with a child before the war, and they both perished as they fled Łódź before the ghetto was completed. He joined the Red Army during the war, and returned to Łódź after it was over where he was reunited with Nacha Frankel.

The collection contains 13 prewar, wartime, and postwar photographs of the Krieger and Frankel families of Łódź, Poland. Included is a prewar childhood photograph of Ben Zion, Kaila, and Shifra Krieger; wartime photographs of the Łódź ghetto, 1941; postwar photographs of Nacha Frankel Krieger, her brother Shlomo Frankel, Yuma Krieger, Yuma Krieger's wife at the Feldafing displaced persons camp; and a camp liberation photograph that is likely a copy.
