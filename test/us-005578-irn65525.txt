Twins Ingeborg and Hans Nussbaum were sent by their parents Toni Sichel and Israel Nussbaum from Berlin, Germany on the Kindertransport to the United Kingdom. They arrived separately in May (Ingeborg) and August (Hans) 1939, and lived in London with the Denham family. Their parents were deported from Berlin to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and in October 1944, to the Auschwitz concentration camp where they are presumed to have perished.

Contains correspondence addressed to Ingeborg [donor] and her twin brother Hans Nussbaum in the United Kingdom, primarily from their parents Toni [Sichel] and Israel Nussbaum in Berlin, Germany.
