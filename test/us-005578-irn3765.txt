German propaganda poster issued in 1941 from the Parole der Woche (Word of the Week) series. The poster references United States Secretary of the Navy, William Franklin "Frank" Knox, calling him a warmonger, likely because he advocated for support of the Allies before the U.S. entry into World War II (1939-1945). Knox, a former political rival of Roosevelt, was appointed as Secretary of the Navy in 1940, to encourage bipartisan support. The poster attempts to frame U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, as a power hungry leader by using a supposed quote about the President by Knox. The text claims that President Roosevelt is a servant of the Jews, and American intervention in the war would lead to disaster for the U.S. The Nazis used propaganda to buttress public support for the war effort, shape public opinion, and reinforce antisemitic ideas. As part of their propaganda campaign, the Nazis created the Word of the Week Series of posters (also referred to as Wandzeitung, or wall newspapers), which began distribution on March 16, 1936. Each week, new posters were placed in public places and businesses to be viewed by as many people as possible. Posters were the primary medium for the series, but smaller pamphlets were also produced, which could be plastered on the back of correspondences. The posters targeted the Nazis’ early political adversaries, Jews, Communists, and Germany’s enemies during the war. The series was discontinued in 1943.
