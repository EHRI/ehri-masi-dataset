Documents and correspondence illustrating the experiences of Maurits Schenkkan, born in 1912 in Berchem, Belgium, who lived in the Netherlands and married to a Catholic German woman, Maria Antosckiewisz. Maurits was deported to Westerbork internment camp in the Netherlands and from there towards Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland. Before arriving in Auschwitz, the train stopped in Cosel, a sub-camp of Auschwitz, and some 200 men were removed from the train, including Mauritz, who went from there to Anhalt, Graeditz, Langenbielau, Faulbrueck and Reichenbach slave labor camps where he was liberated in April 1945. Maria was spared deportation and they reunited at the end of the war. Maurits's parents, Levie and Rozetta, and Maurits's five siblings Leendert, Esther, Clara, David, and Abraham all perished.
