Contains a postcard, dated December 17, 1939 sent by Symcha, Zhenya and Luba Bergman (donor’s paternal grandfather and aunts) in Krasnystaw, Poland, addressed to H. Bergman (Hershel Harry Bergman, donor’s father) in Brooklyn, NY; the text reads (in translation), “Dear Son, How are things with you? How do you feel? We are feeling well; the whole family is well! Your brother Jankel is in the POW camp in Germany. Best regards and kisses from your parents and family. Symcha Bergman.” Also two photographic portraits of Sara and Symcha Bergman (donor’s paternal grandparents) in Krasnystaw, Poland. Only four out of fourteen siblings of Harry Bergman survived the Holocaust.
