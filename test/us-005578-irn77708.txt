The diary describes cramped living conditions, meager food supplies, frequent threats of discovery, and the death of Kramer’s sister. The autograph book includes autographs, messages, poems, and drawings by Kramer’s childhood friends. Biographical materials consist of certificates and memoranda documenting Kramer’s training and service as a nurse in and around displaced persons camps in Linz, Steyr, and Bad Reichenall as well as affidavits documenting the identities and marriage of Sol Kramer’s parents, Berisch and Ethel Kramer. Photographs depict Clara Kramer’s childhood friends and the Żółkiew synagogue. These photographs were removed from the autograph book described above.
