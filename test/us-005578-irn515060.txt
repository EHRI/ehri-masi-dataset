In spring 1944, the Germans decided to destroy the Ghetto. On August 28, 1944, he was transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.

While there, he met his future wife Estelle. She had been deported from Łódź and survived Auschwitz, Sasel, and Bergen Belsen concentration camps. David emigrated to the United States in 1950.
