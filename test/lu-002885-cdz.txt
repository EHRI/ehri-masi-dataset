When Luxembourg was occupied by Germany in May 1940 the civil administration was in July 1940 given over to the Chef der Zivilverwaltung. At the head of the authority with its headquarter in Luxembourg City was the Gauleiter of the neighboring Gau Mosell Gustav Simon. German plans to integrate Luxembourg in the Reich`s administration failed untill the end of 1944 when the country was again liberated.

The fonds Chef der Zivilverwaltung (CdZ) includes as the highest civilian administrative authority records of all areas in occupied Luxembourg.

Within the fond CdZ there are explicit folders concerning Jews. The "Abteilung IV A: Verwaltung des jüdischen und sonstigen Vermögens" of the CdZ was responsible for the Aryanization of the Jewish property. Part of the fonds related to this are especially "A/4/1/001.IVa: Juden- und Emigrantenvermögen" (Assets of Jews and emigrants). Also other folders with more general titles like the series "A/0: Haushalts-, Besoldungs- und Rechnungsangelegenheiten" of the "Haubtabteilung" includes informations about the confiscation of Jewish property. The folder B/11 "Organisationswesen/Stillhaltekommissar" contains documents about the forced dissolution of Jewish clubs and associations.
