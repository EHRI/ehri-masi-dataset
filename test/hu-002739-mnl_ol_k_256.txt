The Holocaust was not only the largest genocidal operation in 20th century Hungarian history but also a gigantic campaign to systematically rob the wealth of Hungarian Jewry. In Hungary, the Europe-wide campaign of robbery usually referred to by the name of Aryanization had various initiators and a large segment of benefactors in society but it was planned as a state-directed and -controlled process with the Ministry of Finance playing a crucial role in it. Between 1938 and 1944, the Ministry was headed by Lajos Reményi-Schneller (1892-1946), i.e. he served as Minister under the successive governments of Darányi, Imrédy, Teleki (his second term), Bárdossy, Kállay, Sztójay, Lakatos and Szálasi. Reményi-Schneller even had the position of economic superminister in the governments of Teleki, Bárdossy and Kállay. His policies were strongly in favor of Nazi Germany during the war years. In 1946, he was sentenced to death and executed as part of the Sztójay-trial. The collection of Classified Presidential Documents contains some relevant materials for the study of anti-Semitic radicalization in Hungary such as, most obviously, boxes 35-37 which include proofs of origin in the age of anti-Semitic discrimination.
