Sudetenland Jews: reports

1 folder

Nothing is known about the provenance of these 3 reports on the situation of Jews in Sudetenland, c1939. Nor is it clear who the authors are or the circumstances in which they were written. The only clues to the latter is the following information taken from the reports themselves.<br /><br />The first report (-/1) has the reference '6-Jo/M' and is dated 6 March 1939 The second report (-/2) has the reference 'J/M.' and is dated 9 March 1939. It is possible that J. M. and Jo. M. are the initials to one and the same person. The second report (-/2) commences with a reference by the author to his journey throughout Sudetenland which ended on 5 March 1939. The third paragraph of the same report states that in the absence of any representative Jewish authorities, it is incumbent on the <em>Reichsvereinigung</em> to address what the author regards as the most pressing problems facing Sudetenland's Jewish population (the remainder of the report expands on these problems). It is possible that <em>Reichsvereinigung</em> is the shortened form of <em>Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland</em>, the only Jewish organisation permitted by the Nazis at this time. In which case the report may have either been commissioned by this organisation or came about as the result of its activities. Evidence which supports this theory and serves to suggest a similar rationale behind the undated and uninitialed third report (-/3) is a reference to the <em>Reichsvertretung</em> (or possibly <em>Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland</em> which was the forerunner to the Reichsvereinigung). In the final section to the third report entitled 'Necessary (immediate) steps' it suggests the immediate establishment of a Sudetenland department within the <em>Reichsvertretung</em>

All three reports deal with the position of Jews in Sudetenland but vary in their specific subject matter. the first (-/1) concentrates on the situation as it effects Jews in various Sudetenland towns and cities. The second (-/2) reviews conditions for Jews throughout the whole of Sudetenland under the headings of 'welfare', 'old people's homes', 'children's schooling' and 'emigration'.<br /><br />The third report (-/3) reviews the social, economic and legal situation of the Jews in Sudetenland and recommends action to address problems arising from the report.
