Sobibor Interviews 1983-1984, interview 13, Stephan Stelmaszuk and Tadeus Syczuk

Interview with Stephan Stelmaszuk (Nidzia 1928) and Tadeus Syczuk (Dorohucza 1923). Stelmaszuk and his family lived about four kilometres away from Sobibor. Sometimes he could smell the stench of burned bodies. His mother gave food to two survivors of the uprising. He knew little about the camp, because 'all you saw was a fence around it'. Syczuk, a railway employee, witnessed abuse and mass destruction. He heard people crying and screaming, an engine starting: 'It lasted fifteen minutes and that was it.'
