Heinz Herbert Klein was born on June 13, 1924 in Vienna, Austria, to Robert and Elsa (née Rosenblum) Klein. He had one younger sister, Fritzi (1928-2014). Robert operated his family's automobile garage and repair shop, which was located adjacent to the family's house. After the Anschluss, Robert and his business partner, Franz Müller, were forced to sell the shop to a Nazi at a steep discount. In the spring of 1939, Heinz Herbert was sent to England on a Kindertransport, while his sister, Fritzi, was sent to the United States on the "50 children" transport organized by Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus. Robert and Elsa were able to immigrate in November 1939; Heinz Herbert joined them a year later. In 1943, Heinz Herbert enlisted in the United States Army and served with the 45th Division.
