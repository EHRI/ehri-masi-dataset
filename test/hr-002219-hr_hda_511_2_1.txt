109 books (green books)

The Dotrsicna park in Zagreb is the site of the mass murder where around 18 000 citizens of Zagreb and its surroundings were shot during the Fascist regime due to their ethnic background, or the fact they were anti-regime. Thanks to archivists Josipa Paver and Igor Graovac, there was systematic work on the names of the victims from 1967 until the late 1990s. 

The project started in the State Archive back in 1967, and lasted, with interruptions, until April 1985. The project examined the records of the Croatian State Archives, the former archives of the Institute of History of the labor movement, the Revolution Museum in Zagreb and the Historical Archives of the City of Zagreb, the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Zagreb, Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb, Yugoslavia Archive, Army History Institute and the Institute of Military Medical Documentation in Belgrade. In addition to research archives, the examiners viewed the contemporary press, gathered witness statements, etc. For each killed person they made ​an ​identification sheet with basic personal information and information about the time and place and manner of death, indicating the sources (a total of 18,627 biographies, bound in 113 books) . In the above-mentioned number of registered victims, 6537 can be identified as Jews.
