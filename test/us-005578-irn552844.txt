Felix Rosenthal (1917-2009) was born and raised in Munich, Germany, but following the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933, he moved to Italy, settling in Florence, where his mother's family was from. He finished his secondary schooling there, and began to study engineering at the Istituto Politecnico in Milan until his studies were interrupted by anti-Semitic laws promulgated by the Fascist government in 1938, which prohibited Jews from studying in public universities. He then moved to Paris, but since he was in Switzerland when war broke out in 1939, rather than returning to France, he left for Chile the following year. and then arrived in the United States in 1941. He joined his brother, Bernard, in Berkeley, Calfornia, and enrolled in the University of California to continue his studies. He joined the United States Army in 1943, serving in military intelligence as a "Ritchie Boy," one of a number of native German speakers who had been trained at Camp Ritchie, Maryland. After service in the European Theatre and discharge in 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete his studies in architecture, obtaining bachelor's and master's degrees there, and opening his own practice as an architect in San Francisco in 1948. In the early 1970s he moved to Zurich, Switzerland, to manage his family's antiquarian book business, and returned to the Bay Area in 1982, when he retired. Felix Rosenthal died in Berkeley on 3 October 2009. [adapted from obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle, 15 October 2009]
