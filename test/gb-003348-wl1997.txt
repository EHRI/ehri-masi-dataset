1 folder

Clarence Bowman, husband of the donor, formerly in the 17th/ 21st Lancers, possibly involved in the liberation of the camps, came into possession of this manuscript

The author, Erich Berger, was born in December 1899 in Schwelm, Westphalia. He lost his parents, wife and children in the war and had been in camps since 1938 without interruption. It is thought that he was a political prisoner and not Jewish.

This report describes conditions in Buchenwald then Mauthausen for this former prisoner. The collection also includes a handwritten summary of the contents in English.
