Alice Fink: Family papers

1 folder

Alice Fink (n√©e Redlich), was born in Berlin in 1920. She came to England in November 1938 where she did her nurse's training at a hospital in Greenwich. She joined the Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad and went to Bergen Belsen with the Jewish Relief Unit in September 1946. She married Hans Finke in June 1948. She moved to Chicago in 1949.<br><br>Her family, with whom she communicated via the Red Cross, remained in Berlin until they were deported and ultimately perished in the Holocaust. They were transported at different times. The only reference to the deportations in the correspondence is a Red Cross Telegram reply dated 9 December 1942, signed by her mother and Heinz (brother?), in which they ask Alice whether she informed 'Tante Hedwig' [herself already deported by this time] that her father had gone to Adi's. He had in fact already been deported to the East by this time.

These family papers, including original correspondence, document in part the life of a German Jewish refugee.
