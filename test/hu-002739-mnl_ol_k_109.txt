The fragments of the survived records of the Hungarian embassies and other diplomatic corps were handed over to the Hungarian National Archives in 1950. The material was reorganized at the end of the 1950s and in the 1960s-1970s as well. The first finding aids were published in 1959 and 1964, followed by a revised second edition in 2003. The records of the Hungarian Consulate in Amsterdam are organized by thematic units and in chronologic order.

The Hungarian Consulate in Amsterdam was established in 1922, and its status was changed to consulate general in 1924. After the Nazi occupation in 1940, when the Embassy (Consulate) in the Hague was closed down, the jurisdiction of the Hungarian Consulate General of Amsterdam covered the entire territory of the occupied Netherlands until the end of the war in 1945.
