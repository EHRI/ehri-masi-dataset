folder

1

Consists of 68 post-war photographs from the collection of Jacques Ribons (Jakub Rybsztain), originally of Strzemieszyce, Poland. Jacques, along with his brother Bernard, was sent to Blechhammer concentration camp from the Strzemieszyce ghetto, while their mother and sister were deported to Auschwitz, where they perished. Their father had died earlier after being shot on the streets of the ghetto. The brothers were then sent to Gross-Rosen, and, in January 1945, they were sent on a death march to Buchenwald, where Jacques was liberated at age 17. He and Bernard were sent to France to recuperate. The photographs were taken of other survivors and of life in Chateau d' Ambloy, France.
