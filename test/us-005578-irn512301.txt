Irene Engelman was born in 1917 in Łódź to Chaim Leib Lipnowski (1880-circa 1944) and Masza Lipnowska (nee Beatus, 1890-circa 1944). She married Edmund Engelman and arrived in the United States with him in 1939 on a student visa. Her parents and grandfather, Herman Beatus, were moved to the Łódź Ghetto in 1940 where her grandfather died. Her parents were transported to Auschwitz in August 1944 and are believed to have been killed there. Her sister Halina Wolkowicz (1913-circa 1944) followed her husband, Michał Wolkowicz, to Warsaw in late 1939 or early 1940. They lived in the Warsaw Ghetto, and Halina is believed to have been killed at Auschwitz.

The Irene Engelman correspondence includes letters to Engelman and her husband in New York from her parents, sister and brother-in-law, and grandfather documenting her family members' lives in the Łódź and Warsaw Ghettos and their emigration efforts. Additional letters from a family friend describe her grandfather's death, her parents' transport to Auschwitz, and her sister and brother-in-law's unknown fates.
