The Gestapo Office in Szczecin was under the command of the Berlin Gestapo office. The Szczecin Office conducted surveillance on all activities in the region (organizations and individual persons). The Gestapo Office included three sections organized into departments: 1. Organizational matters; 2. Domestic surveillance of “enemies”; 3. Intelligence and counterintelligence. Primary functions of the Szczecin Gestapo included surveillance of Jews and Jewish organizations, conducting regional operations to register and expel the Jewish population and implementing discriminatory measures against Jews. The activities of the gestapo ceased upon the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.
