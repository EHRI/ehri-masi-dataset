The papers consist of a publication and two letters relating to refugees at the Kitchener internment camp in Richborough, England, and an internment camp on the Isle of Man during World War II. In a special camp, Kitchener, in Richborough, Kent, England, some 5,000 people who needed immediate shelter were housed during an eighteen - month period from the end of Jan. 1939. These 5,000 refugees had been released from concentration camps, or their internment had been deferred by the Nazis, who were willing to let them alone on condition that they leave Germany immediately. The Home Office gave them a group entrance visa and waived the normal regulations for passports and individual permits.
