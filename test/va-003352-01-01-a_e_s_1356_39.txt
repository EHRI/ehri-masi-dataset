Le professeur Schmutzer et le P. Strathmann O. P. au Pape Pie XII

Prof. Schmutzer and the Dominican friar Strathmann write to Pope Pius XII about an International Committee for Catholic refugees. The letter third annexe (A.E.S. 5190/38) is a memorandum written by Pope Pie XII (at that time cardinal Eugenio Pacelli) in 1938, who suggests protecting converted-to-Catholicism Jews who are forced to leave Italy and Germany.
