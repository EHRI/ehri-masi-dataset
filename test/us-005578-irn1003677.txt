Title on screen: "Umfassende Schulungsarbeit der Maenner der Partei lenkt die weltanschauliche Ausbildung." [loosely: Ideological instruction by the men of the party] The camera pulls back slowly from a man in a Nazi party uniform. He stands at the head of a table and speaks animatedly to a group of Volksdeutsch, who sit and listen attentively. Another similar scene, although briefer. The next scenes show further instruction given to Volksdeutsch. Close-up and medium shots of a speaker and people listening in the audience. The young women and men in the audience wear uniforms. The light is low but bright on certain faces, making the scene rather eerie. Title on screen: Musterung fuer die Waffen-SS [medical examination for the Wafffen-SS]. Young bare-chested men are examined. The scene switches to show an audience watching a group of folk dancers perform. The stage is decorated with swastika banners. Close-ups of audience members enjoying the show. The next performance features a group of girls dressed in athletic clothes (shorts and tank tops). They sit on the stage beneath swastikas, Nazi eagle emblems, and a banner reading "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fueher." Their routine consists of slapping their hands on their knees in unison and chanting. Title on screen: "Einbuergerung der Rueckwanderer in die deutsche Volksgemeinschaft" [Naturalization of the emigrants into the German community]. Scenes of the Bessarabian Germans registering and receiving identification documents. Family groups sit at tables while female clerks fill out paperwork. One woman is photographed against a white background. A nurse pricks the ear of a woman and squeezes a drop of blood onto a glass slide. A family sits at a table with a sign reading: "Berufseinsatzstelle," where they are presumably being interviewed as to their occupations. The clerk hangs an ID card around the little girl's neck. Close-up of a man signing an immgration document. A Nazi party official moves down a line of Volksdeutsch, shaking hands with each of them in turn. The last scene shows a party official giving a speech at a podium and then leading the assembled audience in a Hitler salute.
