Consists of one manuscript, in print and on CD-ROM, entitled "A Long Road Home: The Life and Times of Grisha Sklovsky, 1915-1995", written by John Nicholson in 2007. Mr. Sklovksy was born in Siberia, but following the Russian Revolution, his family moved to Berlin, where he attended school. In 1934, Mr. Sklovsky moved to France and studied at the University of Lyon. In October 1939, he joined the Czech Brigade and spent the war fighting with the British Army, while his mother, Chaja Sklovsky, was deported from Drancy in 1942 and perished in the Holocaust. In 1947, Mr. Sklovsky immigrated to Australia, where he reunited with his fiancee, Celia Weigall, whom he had met before the war, and became an important figure in Australian national television and radio.
