Ferencz discusses war crimes and Yugoslavia

Canadian Broadcasting Company, Prime Time News. Yugoslavia: War Crimes Tribunal. Discussion among host, Benjamin Ferencz, and Major General Lewis Mackenzie, United Nations Commander in Sarajevo, about the legal and political problems of establishing an international war crimes tribunal in Yugoslavia. Ferencz speaks about the precedents of Nuremberg: 1) war crimes; 2) crimes against humanity; and 3) crimes against peace. He relates the two experiences, declaring the existence of war crimes in Yugoslavia. Ferencz argues that it should be simple to obtain conviction in Yugoslavia as overwhelming and massive evidence is available. Mackenzie indicates that we "must put the marker down somewhere and there's no better place to start than Bosnia." Ferencz agrees, asking how much the world is willing to take: "It's not time to just wring our hands, we've got to start to wring some necks!"
