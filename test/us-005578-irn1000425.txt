Gdynia surrenders; Volksdeutsch refugees

Refugees walking on the road. Several shots of people sitting by river, near destroyed bridge (narration identifies them as Volksdeutsche); people arrive at riverbank in small boats. Sick and wounded are helped to walk, refugees eating (all identified as "suffering Volksdeutsche"). German soldier hands out candy to little girl; kids gathered around in small crowd. Bandaged, forlorn men.
