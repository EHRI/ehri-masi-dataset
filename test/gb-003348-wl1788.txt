2 boxes

Magdalena Maria ("Lene") HÃ¶llering was born in Vienna in 1899. She trained to become a nursery nurse. She got married to Erich Schulhof (born in 1887) in 1922, joint owner of a family business. The couple and their two children, Thomas (born 1923) and Martina (born 1925), lived in a large villa with domestic servants in Berlin-Wannsee. In 1938 Erich Schulhof was forced to sell his business due to the Aryanisation in Germany. He did not receive any money for the sale of the business or the family home. The family together with Erich Schulhof's mother, Ida (nee Mann), emigrated to England in the same year.<div><span style="line-height: 1.22;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.22;">Erich Schulhof tried to establish a new business but it was destroyed in the bombing raids in 1940. In 1940 Erich Schulhof was interned as an enemy alien. In the meantime the family moved to the country in Gloucestershire where Magdalena spent most of the war years working at a farm. Erich received permission to work in 1942 and soon started working as a teacher. He was made redundant in 1945 when the teacher he had replaced returned from military service. He suddenly died in 1948. Magdalena later changed her surname by depoll to Mayne-Sutton.</span></div>
