Untitled World War II and post-war memoir of Ruth Templehof Szorecki, born in Łódź, Poland. The memoir tells the story of the family from 1939 to 1962. The Szorecki family worked in the Warsaw ghetto, escaping selections by hiding, until the family managed to escape to the non-Jewish sector of Warsaw, Poland, in 1942. They posed as non-Jews for the remainder of the war and in 1949 emigrated to the United States.
