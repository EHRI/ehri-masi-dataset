Stalhelm parade, speeches

Title: "German royalists recall war in military show - Stahlhelm reviewed by von Papen, Crown Prince, and Gen. von Mackensen." Scenes of the Stahlhelm marching with banners. Crown Prince Wilhelm shown watching the parade and saluting. Franz von Papen, Wilhelm von Gayl, and Kurt von Schleicher are also shown briefly. The camera then focuses on General August Mackensen, a well-known World War I field commander. He is shown wearing the uniform and large furry hat of the Death's Head Hussar regiment. The camera switches back to the Stahlhelm troops, panning left to right over them standing and saluting, as "Deutschland Ueber Alles" is sung. The "Stahlhelm" [steel helmet], founded in part by Franz Seldte, was a nationalist veteran's organization, which grew to be one of the largest paramilitary organizations in the Weimar Republic.
