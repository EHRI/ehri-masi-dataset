The poster was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018 by Ken Sutak and Sherri Venokur.

The Cinema Judaica Collection consists of more than 1,200 objects relating to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical subjects, from 1923 to 2000, from the United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. The collection was amassed by film memorabilia collector Ken Sutak, to document Holocaust-and Jewish-themed movies of the World War II era and the postwar years. The collection includes posters, lobby and photo cards, scene stills, pressbooks, trade ads, programs, magazines, books, VHS tapes, DVDS, and 78 rpm records. Sutak organized these materials into two groups, “Cinema Judaica: The War Years, 1939–1949” and “Cinema Judaica: The Epic Cycle, 1950–1972” and, in conjunction with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum (now the Dr. Bernard Heller Museum in New York), organized exhibitions on these two themes in 2007 and 2008. Sutak subsequently authored companion books with the same titles.

One-sheet poster for the film, “Tomorrow, The World!” released by United Artists in December 1944. The film was based on a popular 1943 Broadway play of the same name, and centers around a 12-year-old member of the Hitler Youth who moves to the United States to live with his American uncle. Despite his parents’ deaths in a concentration camp, the young boy is entrenched in Nazi ideology, and is arrogant, insulting, and outwardly antagonistic towards his uncle’s Jewish fiancée. The adults debate over the best way to handle the boy, and by extension, Nazi Germany. After a more physical tactic ends in disaster, the characters find that a compassionate and loving approach breaks through. This serves as a metaphor for how to treat the ordinary German citizens living under the brutality of the Nazi regime. “Tomorrow, the World!” carries an underlying message that they were unwillingly forced into the Nazi ideology, and the film promotors even suggested that local discussions should held. This object is one of more than 1,200 objects in the Cinema Judaica Collection of materials related to films about World War II and the Holocaust as well as Jewish, Israeli, and biblical themes.
