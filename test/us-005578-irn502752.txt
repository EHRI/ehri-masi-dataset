Edith Krasa Kramer (née Liebeck, 1899-1994) was born on 7 October 1899 in Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). She studied medicine in Königsberg and Munich. She married in 1925 after meeting her future husband in Berlin, Germany. He lost his job at Charité Hospital and died in 1937 of natural causes. In March 1942 she was sent to Posen, Germany (Poznań, Poland) to treat women prisoners at Fort Radziwill. She was later accused of sabotage and arrested by the Gestapo in 1943. She was imprisoned in Posen, Berlin-Alexanderplatz, and then Theresienstadt. After liberation she went to Switzerland and then immigrated to Australia in 1948. She studied medicine in Syndey, Australia. In 1951 Edith married Friedrich Kramer (b. 1902), a Czech musician who fled Vienna, Austria for Australia in 1938.
