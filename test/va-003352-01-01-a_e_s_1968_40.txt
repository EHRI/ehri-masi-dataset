Unavailable.

Cardinal Maglione informs Orsenigo that the Pope, responding to Father Grösser's last visit to Rome, decided to reserve 30 000 dollars to Raphaelsverein. This amount will be used to:
- help non-Aryan Germans (including non-catholic non-Aryan Germans);
- facilitate the emigration to Brasil of 3 000 catholic non-Aryan Germans.
Cardinal Maglione says that the Brazilian Ambassador told him that baptised Jews only will be admitted.
