Nathan Gutman (b.1927 ) was born to a Jewish family in Katowice, Poland. During the Holocaust he was interned in the Krakow-Plaszow, Mauthausen and St. Valentin camps. After World War II he immigrated to Israel where he volunteered for the Israeli Navy. In 1963 he came to the United States to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.

The memoir, "The execution of capo Beim," describes Nathan Gutman's experiences during the Nazi occupation of Poland; his internment in Krakow-Płaszów; and his relationship with a kapo in that camp before the Nazis put the kapo to death.
