Hilde Sanderson: family papers

2 folders, 1 bundle

These papers were in the possession of Hilde Sanderson (née Tachauer) and were appropriated by Stanley Tash (formerly Sally Tachauer), her brother and the depositor, after her death in 1981.

Rosa and Hedwig Seelig owned and ran a hotel for a relatively affluent clientele in Bad Kissingen, Bavaria. After the place was plundered during Kristallnacht, the two sisters went to live at a Jewish home for the aged in Frankfurt. They perished in Auschwitz during the war.

Isak Tachauer was the father.
