Hitler returns to Berlin in July 1940

Camera pans over Upper Rhine. Hitler's motorcade crosses pontoon bridge eastwards; tracking shot shows children in swimsuits waving near a customs post and adults showing signs of love, loyalty and gratitude. Hitler, now aboard train, accepts flower from girl and shakes hands of HJ boy. Train journey continues past Marbach (Neckar), peasant on his plow, and stops at stations where Hitler autographs postcard portraits of himself. Camera shows Hitler in profile. Berlin prepares welcome; swastika flags fly, BDM girls spread flowers along route from Anhalter Bahnhof to Reichs Chancellery, policemen wait, spectators climb trees for better views and human barriers struggle to hold back enthusiastic crowds. Fanfare at Anhalter Bahnhof greets arrival of Hitler's train. Hitler, accompanied by Raeder, von Brauchitsch and Goering, is greeted by Frick, Schacht, SA chief Lutze, and von Neurath. Bells ring as party moves out of station, past waving crowds, and Hitler reviews guard of honor. Standing in open Mercedes, Hitler is cheered by civilians, including shrieking women.
