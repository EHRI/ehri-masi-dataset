The collection consists of six photographs: five photographs collected by Wolf Goldsztajn [donor's stepfather] depict Siegmund "Zisha" Breitbart, a Jewish strong man of the 1920's, and one photograph shows Jewish refugee youth in Munich, Germany, marching in an anti-British demonstration protesting Palestine policy in 1947. Zelig Gorszkiewicz [donor's father] is second from left in the first row.
