Fritz Goldschmidt: Diaries and eyewitness testimony

1 MF Reel

This collection was part of a series, the originals of which were sent to the Wiener Library in Tel Aviv.

Fritz Goldschmidt was born in Breslau in 1893, the son of a doctor, who founded the first Jewish student fraternity in 1886. He died in 1968. He was a judge in the High Court in Berlin. Shortly after the Nazis came to power, new legislation precluded him from continuing in the profession and he devoted most of his time to working for the <em>Central Verein Deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens</em> as the representative for Charlottenburg.

This collection consists of a 288 page manuscript diary and a 71 page personal account, both of which provide valuable evidence for the persecution of German Jewry in the Third Reich.
