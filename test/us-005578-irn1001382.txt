Ostarbeiter games; Parade of SS Galicia in Kolomja; Estonian Waffen SS battalion

Several shots of different groups of people on a field, each with a sign indicating their nationality: Protektorat, Kroaten, Franzosen, Belgier, Hollander, Ostarbeiter, Italiener, Bulgaren, Ostarbeiter. The narration indicates that these are work teams living and working in Germany. They go on to engage in athletic competitions, including tug of war, a track race, and a soccer game (France vs. Protektorat, France wins). Military ceremony for the SS Waffen Division Galicia in Kolymyja, Ukraine. Men stand on a wooden platform in a field, surrounded by a crowd. They carry flags and military standards, including what may be a variation on the Lviv coat of arms (or perhaps on the West Ukrainian People's Republic's coat of arms, which itself is likely a variation on the Lviv one), several swastika flags, at least two SS standards, and a banner with sword painted down the middle, reading "For Ukraine, For Freedom, For Honor, For Glory. --- U.G.A. 1918". SS Galiciana men parade through town, some dressed in traditional Ukrainian (and even Cossack or Tatar) clothing, others in civilian clothing, others in military garb. Translation of Ukrainian narration: A sport festival took place in [a German city, name not audible] among European work teams whose members work in Germany. Race. National teams. And the winner is France. A soccer match between France and the Protectorate. The French are wearing bright shirts. And the French team wins 2 to 1. [Kolomyja/Galicia/Western Ukraine.] In Kolomyja, Ukraine, a manifestation of volunteer units took place. This area in Eastern Galicia contributed the largest number of volunteers to the newly formed SS-Galicia division. The governor addressing the manifestation said: "By joining these ranks of volunteers you confirm that you are not keeping apart from the European battle but together with others you accept the battle. You want to serve your homeland and a new Europe. Your fight is for a better and greater future. And this fight will continue until the very end." Shoulder to shoulder with the German soldiers these volunteers are going to fight against the Bolsheviks.
