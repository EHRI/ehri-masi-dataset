Sylvia Glickman: Am I a Murderer?

Am I a Murderer? (1996-97) is a cantata for bass voice, flute, piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, violin, viola, cello and piano, which Sylvia Glickman composed for basso Julian Rodescu. As in the familiar “Pierrot ensemble,” the flute/piccolo part, the clarinet/bass clarinet part, and the violin/viola part may each be played by a single performer. The singer speaks and sings the text written by Frank Fox, translator of the diary of Calel Perechodnik, a Polish Jewish policeman. Perechodnik was promised by the Nazis that his family would be saved if he helped to round up Jews for deportation. He assisted the Germans, but lost his family. His diary was found after he committed suicide. 1. Introduction (flute/piccolo, clarinet, violin, viola, cello, piano) 2.
