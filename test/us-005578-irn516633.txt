Carl Doernberg was born on March 16, 1875, in Eschwege, Germany. Hedwig Doernberg was born on July 15, 1882, in Gottingen, Germany. They had two sons born in Eschwege: Curt (b. 1910) and Albert (b. 1908). The family owned a textile mill and traveled extensively for business. In 1938, Curt, who had been educated as a lawyer, was arrested and deported to a concentration camp where he remained for approximately a year until he was able to flee to the United States. Carl, Hedwig, and Albert left Eschwege in 1939 and sought refuge in Portugal where they remained for approximately two years until they were able to immigrate to the United States in 1941.

The papers consist of two passports and two identification cards relating to the Doernberg family's flight from Eschwege, Germany, to Portugal. The collection includes German passports ("Reisepass"), German identification cards ("Kennkarte"), and Portuguese identification papers (Bilhete de Identidade) for Hedwig and Carl Doernberg, David Doernberg's paternal grandparents, who fled from Germany to Portugal in 1939, arriving in the United States in 1941.
