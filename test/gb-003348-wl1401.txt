In 1936 it was Aryanised and the Hollaender family opened the Jewish Private Music School Hollaender (Juedische Private Musikschule Hollaender) in Berlin Charlottenburg. It became important for the Jewish pupils because they were not allowed into state schools anymore. It had to close in 1938 and the head of the school, Susanne Hollaender was transported to Auschwitz on 29 January 1943
