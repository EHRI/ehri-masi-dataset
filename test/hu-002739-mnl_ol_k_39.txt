Kállay Miklós miniszterelnök iratai

14 fasc., 1,96 linear metres

The correspondence was acquired by the Hungarian National Archives in 1948.

Miklós Kállay (1887-1967), politician, Minister of Agriculture in the cabinet of Gyula Gömbös who then served as Prime Minister of Hungary between 1942 and 1944. Kállay belonged among the more moderate members of the establishment but largely kept the ministers who served under his predecessor Bárdossy in their positions. His premiership was characterized by a new Hungarian foreign policy aimed at the cautious distancing of the country from Nazi Germany and the initiation of negotiations with the Western Allies, especially Great Britain. Hungary refused to deport its large Jewish population under his premiership. The situation of Jews in the country did not significantly deteriorate but it certainly did not improve either. Kállay was forced to resign once Nazi Germany entered Hungary on March 19, 1944 and he sought asylum at the Turkish Embassy. The collection contains a fragment of the semi-official correspondence of Miklós Kállay. While a significant part of the correspondence is of a personal nature (invitations, greetings, etc.), a substantial part concerns the implementation of the anti-Jewish laws. Moreover, the correspondence contains information on the organization of the war economy, associations in the service of the Hungarian war effort, on Hungarian-Italian relations, minority issues (especially concerning the German minority of Hungary), party life, political visits, Church questions and questions of propaganda.
