David Title (circa 1900-1960) was born in Opatów, Poland and immigrated to Toronto, Canada as a child. In 1921 David immigrated to the United States and settled in New York. He worked as a pattern maker for dresses in the garment industry. He married Judith Rebecca Heitner (25 April 1909-23 March 1972) in 1933. Judith was born in England and immigrated to the United States in 1922. Their daughter Jacqueline was born in 1936. During World War II, David organized what would be known at the United Apter Relief, an organization that provided financial aid and assistance to Jews from Opatów. He served as the secretary-treasurer of the New York branch and on 30 December 1941, the group held its first meeting to organize relief efforts on behalf of the town. There were also branches in Toronto and Montreal, Canada. These efforts intensified after the war and continued till 1952, to assist the approximately 300 Jewish survivors of the town. Among those who survived was David’s aunt, Regina Teitelbaum. Her late husband, Mortke Teitelbaum (David’s uncle), had been head of the Judenrat in Opatów and died of disease in Auschwitz. David died from an illness on 22 July 1960.

The collection documents David Title’s involvement with United Apter Relief, a charitable organization that operated from 1942-1952 and provided financial relief and assistance to Jewish immigrants from Opatów, Poland residing in New York, Toronto, Montreal, Palestine, and displaced persons camps. The collection primarily consists of David’s organizational files, which include case files, financial documents, correspondence, notes, newsletters, and a notebook. The case files are interfiled with other materials and include letters, photographs, and documents related to individuals the organization was trying to help, many of whom were survivors in DP camps. The collection also includes subject files regarding United Apter Relief and Opatów that were organized by David’s daughter Jacqueline Title. The subject files contain research on the organization, Opatów during the Holocaust, survivors, memorials, and David’s background, and primarily consist of clippings, copies of articles, and print-outs from the Internet.
