Charles R. Lord (1920-2010) was born on 5 January 1920 in Grinnell, Iowa to Jesse and Elizabeth Lincoln Lord. He grew up on a farm, and graduated with a degree in agriculture from Berea College in 1942. During the World War II, Charles was a registered conscientious objector, and worked with the Civilian Public Service. He married Josephine (Joy) Swift in 1945. After the war, Charles was involved with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). On 1 November 1946, Charles and the members of the SS Carroll Victory “Cattleboat I” left Baltimore, Maryland bound for Kavala, Greece. Known as the Heifers for Relief project, the trip was one of many to bring horses and other livestock to European farms in efforts to help them recover after World War II.

The ship returned to New York on 27 March 1947. Charles, Josephine, and their three children performed missionary work in Southern Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) from 1954-1965. After returning to the United States, Charles became a teacher and pastor, and continued his missionary work in Africa through 1982.

Lord’s trip aboard the SS Carroll Victory “Cattleboat I” to deliver livestock to Greece as part of a relief mission by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from November 1946 to March 1947.
