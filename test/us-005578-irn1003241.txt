50,000 Communists at Berlin May Day celebration

50,000 Communists at Berlin May Day demonstration. The camera pans over a huge crowd, holding signs, banners, and flags. They sing the Internationale (?). A man speaks but the words are barely audible. He is shot from far back in the crowd and not identifiable. He is then shown closer up briefly, but then flags obscure half of his face. The camera pans over the crowds as they leave the demonstration. The audio (crowd noises) cuts out at 6:04. Police are shown dispersing and perhaps arresting people in the crowd. Slow pan of immense crowds with Berlin Cathedral in background.
