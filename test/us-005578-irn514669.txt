The papers consist of a photograph of three boys, a photograph of a boy in glasses, a scrapbook containing 25 pages of memorabilia and photographs related to the beginnings of Kibbutz Buchenwald, and a certificate of incarceration stating that Fredy Diament was a concentration camp prisoner. Kibbutz Buchenwald was organized in 1945 by survivors of Buchenwald concentration camp and was the first pioneer training group formed in Germany after liberation. In the summer of 1945, the founding group departed for Palestine where they eventually established their own independent settlement in 1948. This settlement exists as Kibbutz Netzer Sereni in Israel today.
