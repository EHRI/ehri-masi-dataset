Ilse Rothschild (later Schwersenz and Leiner, b. 1910) was born to Salli (Salomon, Sally, 1881-1946) and Johanna Rothschild (née Friesem, 1881-1968). Salli owned a bakery in Bremen, Germany and had three children: Ilse, Rolf, and Adolf. Ilse married Arno Schwersenz (later Sherran) and they had a son, Jack (born Jakob Schwersenz, later Jack Leiner, 1936-2019), born in Bremen. Salli and Johanna sent Rolf to Palestine and Johanna soon followed, but she returned to Germany. In the late 1930s Salli became increasingly worried for their safety. He saw an advertisement in the newspaper from a baker in the United States who wanted to return to Germany. Salli and the other baker reached an agreement to exchange bakeries and Johanna, Salli, and Adolf left for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ilse, Arno, and Jack followed in 1937. They attempted to bring other family members to the United States, but were unsuccessful and everyone perished. Arno and Ilse divorced when Jack was a child and Ilse later married Elias Leiner. Jack married Maxine Krim (b. 1937) and had three children: Sally (b. 1958), Kim (b.1960), and Eric (b.1963).

The Rothschild family papers include biographical material, printed material, writings, and photographs relating to Salli and Johanna Rothschild and their family before the war in Bremen, Germany, their immigration, and the relocation of their bakery to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1937.

Printed material includes a page from the Pittsburgh Press, dated May 22, 1938, with articles relating to the war as well as a newsletter titled The Octagram, dated April 21, 1945. Correspondence consists mainly of letters to Salli from Rosalie Alter(?), Johanna’s sister, as well as a letter to A. Rothschild which includes a recipe. The series also includes a diary kept by Johanna Rothschild while on a trip to Palestine in 1935. Photographs include pre-war and wartime photographs and photographic postcards of the Rothschild family in Bremen, Germany and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the late 1930s and 1940s, including photographs in front of their bakery in Germany and the United States.
