Arthur Lehmann was born August 23 1877 in Mönchengladbach, Germany. He later grew up in Würzburg, and studied architecture and art. After school he settled in Mannheim, where he owned and operated his own architectural business. He also contributed to the local newspaper as a critic and worked as the manager of the Kunstverein (art institute). He served in these positions for over 25 years. In that time, he married and had one child, Richard, in 1916. He became widowed in 1932. That next year, with the Hitler regime in power, Arthur lost all his sources of income. Due to his Jewish heritage, he was banned from the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) which required architects to be a member. Additionally, the newspaper shut down and he lost his position as manager of the Kunstverein. In 1938, Richard left Mannheim for Milan, Italy. Soon after his arrival, he received a visa for travel to Australia. Arthur came to Italy to say goodbye to his son. However, the day that Richard was scheduled to embark, war was declared and the ship did not sail. Richard and Arthur were unable to leave Italy, and stayed in Milan for several years. In 1941, Richard was arrested and sent to Ferramonti di Tarsia concentration camp. Arthur joined him, voluntarily, three months later. Arthur and Richard remained at the camp until it was liberated in 1944. In that time, Richard met and married his wife, Olly. Soon after, the Lehmann family was sent to Oswego, New York as part of the Fort Ontario Emergency Relief Shelter. They remained there until 1946. After leaving the camp, Arthur worked as an architect in Niagara Falls until his death in 1948.

The Lehman family papers document the experience of Arthur Lehmann and his son, Richard, through their imprisonment at the Ferramonti concentration camp in southern Italy, and later as refugees in Fort Ontario. Included in the papers is Arthur’s handwritten memoir, entitled "Scenes of Life in Ferramonti." Another memoir, from Ruth Gruber, titled "I Went to the Soviet Arctic", is also in the papers. Other items include drawings of the room Arthur stayed in while at Fort Ontario, originals and copies of correspondence, autobiographical notes, photographs, and various newspaper clippings. The Lehmann family papers contain primarily documents concerning Arthur and Richard Lehmann’s imprisonment at Ferramonti di Tarsia concentration camp. This includes the handwritten, German, memoir written by Arthur entitled Scenes of Life in Ferramonti. Another memoir, written by Ruth Gruber titled I Went to the Soviet Arctic, is also included. Other items originate from Richard and Arthur’s stay at Fort Ontario, such as drawings of his room, correspondence and instructions concerning their refugee status, and articles written by Arthur intended for the local newspaper, the Ontario Chronicle. The collection also contains copies of correspondence written by Arthur’s sisters, Ida and Regina, written while Arthur was in Ferramonti. Also included are photographs from Ferramonti. The second box of the collection contains photocopies of the original papers found in box one.
