Radio broadcasting; propaganda; German home front

Various radio programs being broadcast in Berlin. An announcer (perhaps Heinz Goedecke?) wishes citizen Heinrich Schultz a happy 90th birthday; a group of children performs songs; an outdoor concert featuring a harmonica player and other musicians; women wearing native costume singing. The first scene, which does not appear in the USHMM excerpt, shows a man entering a restaurant and speaking to a group of older men about the benefits of listening to the radio, as a way to strengthen the community (?). The last scene shows one of the older men asking to have the radio turned back on, as the man who lectured them leaves the restaurant with a "Heil Hitler" salute.
