The Hungarian Film Office was a branch of the Magyar Távirati Iroda (the Hungarian News Agency). The Film Office was primarily responsible for producing the weekly reports titled Hungarian News and the Hungária 16 mm films. It had a department of photography too, which provided periodicals with photos of current events and the main sites of the country. It also had a department of advertisement, which produced commercials for the movie theaters. The collection contains information on the operation of the film office such as minutes of its meetings on various levels or its budgets and turnover. There is also the miscellaneous correspondence of the Film Office with various similar international organizations, mostly importantly the Italian and the Croatian. Last but not least, the collection includes the copies of the censorship sheets of the Hungarian News as well as the World News from 1924 to 1944 and also their catalogues for the years 1939 to 1941.
