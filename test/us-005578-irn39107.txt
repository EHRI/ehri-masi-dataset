United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Consists of a memoir written in 1947 by Hedwig Frank Ems, originally of Halle, Germany. The memoir, which is in the original German and accompanied by an English translation, describes Mrs. Ems' experiences when she was deported at age 73 from Berlin to Theresienstadt. Mrs. Ems describes life in wartime Berlin, the constant threat of deportation, her deportation in late October 1942, and life in Theresienstadt. She describes life in Theresienstadt in great detail, including death, disease, inspections, and witnessing the mass transports out of the camp. In February 1945, she received notice that she had been selected for a transport to Switzerland (likely a reference to the transport that was based on an agreement between Himmler and Jean-Marie Musy), but she decided not to go. She describes the liberation of Theresienstadt, but remained there until August 1945, when she returned to Berlin. Also includes an excerpt of a letter about Mrs. Ems by Martha Cohen, who lived with her in Theresienstadt and a brief supplement to the memoir in which Mrs. Ems described various anti-Jewish actions.
