1 folder

This collection comprises two reports on the situation of Jewish schools in Poland in 1931 and 1937 respectively. The first focuses on the effect of the anti-Jewish boycott movement; the fears of further restricted entry into the teaching profession; the failure of the Polish Socialist Party in opposing the antisemitic measures and the need for well known writers and professors to voice their disapproval of the current trend. The other report (date of receipt February 1937) provides statistics on the state of school provision for Jewish school children and describes the extent of poverty and deprivation endured by them.
