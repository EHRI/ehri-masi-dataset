The Bund free press and literature (BFPL) was a German association of independent writers and journalists in exile, which was founded in Paris on 7 July 1937th. The founders obtained from a liberal-humanistic base position against the Nazi and Stalinism. Thus, the BFPL was from the outset isolated among the politically active emigrants, who were committed in their vast majority to the communist-dominated popular front policy and were organized in the Association of German Writers (SDS). BFPL founder Hans Sahl called this exile in exile. As the center of exile after the start of World War II moved to the United States, the BFPL dissolved implied. The founding statute of the BFPL begins with the words: "Convinced that freedom of mind and expression is a precious commodity, and that an independent, clean and responsible press and literature, which is not subject to compulsion and terror, is one of the essential conditions for spiritual development and effective spiritual struggle [... ] " According to Dieter Schiller , nobody should belong to the covenant "who, while opening his mouth to a brown Reich culture chamber, accepts a red Reichskulturkammer."
