Six clips from an anti-Jewish Nazi propaganda film

01:12:05 to 01:12:20 Onlookers watch as Jews with horse-drawn carts full of belongings enter Stuttgart after Suess has convinced the Duke to reverse the ban and allow them into the city. A man leading a horse sings the song Shir Hagamal (Song of the Camel). This and many other scenes in the movie were filmed in Prague and Harlan coerced some Jews into performing in this scene and in a later scene set in a synagogue. [This information comes from Susan Tegel's article - see Notes field for citation]. 01:12:26 to 01:12:39 Suess pulls a frightened Dorothea away from the curtain by the window in his bedroom. He pushes her onto the bed and looms over her. [Dorothea has come to beg the Duke to release her husband and her father, who have both been arrested. The Duke is out of town so Dorothea asks Suess instead. Suess arranges for Dorothea to hear the sounds of her husband being tortured and then promises to release him if (it is implied) she will sleep with him]. 01:12:45 to 01:13:00 CU of Dorothea as she runs, clearly upset by what has just happened to her. 01:13:03 to 01:13:18 Faber, accompanied by a crowd of townspeople, carries Dorothea's body to the door of the palace and yells, "Jude! Jude!" Suess's secretary, Levy, appears at the window. (Dorothea has drowned herself after being raped by Suess). 01:13:21 to 01:13:48 Faber lays Dorothea's body down at the door of the palace and puts his head on her chest in grief. 01:13:51 to 01:15:41 Suess, his beard and hair grown out again, stands barefoot in ragged clothing beside a metal cage at the gallows. He almost faints as his sentence is read: he must be hanged for defiling a Christian girl. Snow falls and the whole town has come out to watch the hanging. Suess pleads for his life by saying that he was only serving the Duke and offering money if he is allowed to live. The camera rises with the cage as it is raised high above the square before the floor is released. Zoom in to a CU on Faber's face. The council member who read Suess's sentence says that all Jews must leave the district of Wuertemberg within three days and that he hopes that future generations will adhere to this ban for the sake of their children and their children's children.
