Following the dissolution of the National Committee of Budapest in 1949 the records were taken to the Budapest State Archives

The documentation of the Holocaust (avant la lettre) started in Hungary practically as soon as the war had ended and it took various major forms. The documentation project pursued by the Committee for the Investigation of Nazi and Arrow Cross Atrocities (A náci és nyilas rémtetteket vizsgáló bizottság) were among the most important Hungarian state-based forms of Holocaust documentation. Within days of the liberation of Budapest in February, 1945, the National Committee of Budapest decided to establish this Committee for the Investigation of Nazi and Arrow Cross Atrocities with the aim of making the horrible recent atrocities known as widely as possible. The Committee was to create around twelve thousand files based on the accounts of survivors of persecution and other eyewitnesses. The Committee was also responsible for several other tasks such as the exhumation of victims in unmarked mass graves and providing them with decent burials that also contributed to its project of investigation and documentation.

The Records of the Committee for the Investigation of Nazi and Arrow Cross Atrocities are incorporated into the Records of the Budapest National Committee. The survived records include the documents related to the establishment of the Committee (fasc.9.), further documents related to the activities of the Committee including its correspondence with the Hungarian institutions of justice and investigation, photographs, documents on the burial of dead bodies that were lying in the territory of the ghetto, the protocols the Committee recorded or received in its official capacity, police protocols on fatalities and autopsies, notification forms and its appendixes as well as certifications of the members of the Committee (fascicles 33-39)
