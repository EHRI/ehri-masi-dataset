Ingeborg Bertha Weinberger (née Cohn,1920-2013) was born in Leipzig, Germany to Charlotte and Ludwig Cohn. Her father was a World War I veteran and doctor. Responding to increased Jewish persecution in Germany, Ingeborg's family fled to England, Prague, and Bolivia. Ingeborg emigrated from Leipzig in 1939 to Bolivia. En route to Bolivia, she stopped in Baltimore, Maryland where her boyfriend, Hans Weinberger (b. 1915 to Margarete and Theodor Weinberger), had already immigrated. They married in Baltimore, but Ingeborg was not able to stay in the United States and continued to Bolivia where she lived with her parents. They all later immigrated to the United States. Ingeborg and Hans returned to Germany after Hans got a job as a translator at the Nuremberg Trials. While in Germany, Ingeborg worked at the United States office of Censorship. They later moved back to Baltimore where Ingeborg worked for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS).
