Georges Schreiber, (1904-1977) was an artist born in Brussels, Belgium. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts and worked as a freelance artist for German newspapers as a young man. In 1928, he immigrated to the United States where he found work as an illustrator for books and magazines, a lithographer, and a painter. In the 1930s, Schreiber travelled across America several times, painting images of American life. In 1936, he was employed as an artist by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). During World War II, Schreiber was commissioned by the United States Army and Navy to create images for war posters, and he designed several War Bond posters for the war effort. Schreiberâ€™s work has been exhibited at the Carnegie Institute, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Art Institute of Chicago, Whitney Museum of American Art, Metropolitan Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art.

The United States Office of War Information (OWI) was created on June 13, 1942, to centralize and control the content and production of government information and propaganda about the war. It coordinated the release of war news for domestic use, and using posters along with radio broadcasts, worked to promote patriotism, warn about foreign spies, and recruit women into war work. The office also established an overseas branch, which launched a large-scale information and propaganda campaign abroad. The government appealed to the public through popular culture and more than a quarter of a billion dollars' worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. Victory in Europe was declared on May 8, 1945, and in Japan on September 2, 1945. The OWI ceased operation in September.

Poster for the third War Loan drive showing an alert soldier with his gun at the ready in front of a parachute filled sky. The poster was issued by the Treasury Department to encourage the public to buy war bonds for the third War Loan drive, which occurred from September 8 to October 2, 1943. War bonds were sold at 75 percent of their face value, matured over ten years and could then be redeemed for their full purchase value. Bonds were available in denominations of $25 through $1000. If you could not afford a war bond you could buy war stamps, for 10 cents, which could be saved to purchase a bond. There were 8 war loan drives conducted from 1942 to 1945, and by the end of the war 85 million Americans had purchased 185.7 billion dollars of bonds. The war in Europe ended May 8, 1945, and the war in Japan ended on September 2, 1945.
