2 folders + digital

Dr Suzanne Ullmann was a zoologist, born of Jewish parents in Budapest in 1935. She lectured for many years at the University of Glasgow. Her father, Rudi Ullmann, a jeweller, had moved to London in the hope of setting up a business. Her mother, Lenke Ullmann, née Brueck, followed him out there but was unable to return to Hungary because of WWII. Suzanne along with her younger twin siblings, Joseph and Louis, were looked after by their grandmothers. They remained in Budapest throughout the war experiencing the Nazi occupation and were ultimately saved, it is thought, by residing in the 'Glass House', a safe house created by Carl Lutz, the Swiss Vice-consul in Budapest, who was famed for saving the lives of many thousands of Jews. After the war the three children and the two grandmothers were reunited with the parents in London and their two new twin siblings, John and Eva, with whom communication was difficult as they only spoke English.&nbsp;&nbsp;
