Leah Goltzman was born circa 1938 (possibly 1936) in Chelm, Poland, to Simon Szklasz and Hannah Hochstein. During the Holocaust, she and her parents fled the Nazis across Poland into Russia. They were captured and transported to Stalinsk (Novokuznetsk), Siberia. After the war, they spent five years in displaced persons camps, including in Ebelsberg, Austria (near Linz), before immigrating to the United States in 1950.
