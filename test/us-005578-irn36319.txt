Consists of one memoir, entitled "Ruthie's Story," written by Ruth Meta Samson Bamdas, originally of Germany, about her Holocaust experiences. She describes her childhood in Germany and her training in Switzerland as a baby nurse. When she returned to Germany, she was told to report to the Gestapo, was warned to leave the area, and went to the Polish border. She and her aunt were able to obtain visas in 1937 or 1938 for England where she got a job. In 1945, she immigrated to the United States and reunited with her mother. Includes copies of family photographs.
