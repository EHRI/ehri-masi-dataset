Walter Hamann collection

folder

1

Contains photocopies of documents, copyprint photographs, and a memoir documenting the Nazi persecution of members of the Walter Hamann family who were Jehovah's Witnesses. Hamann's memoir, "Extract of Memories," describes the conditions of his seven-plus years imprisonment in the concentration camp of Neusustrum, in a DuÌˆsseldorf police prison, and in Sachsenhausen, where his brother-in-law died from mistreatment. The photograph of Hamann and some of his male relatives is accompanied by information about their imprisonment. The collection also contains a description of Hamann's education and employment history before 1933 and a photocopy of a letter from Sachsenhausen with a censor's stamp describing the confiscation of the letter because the writer was an "obstinate" Jehovah's Witness.
