German troops return home

Banner welcoming soldiers returning home by train reads a Hearty Welcome to you Brave Soldiers. Women, children and old men wave joyfully, and soldiers descending from railway cars hug girls, who offer flowers, to sound of song including Herrlich ist die Heimat. Tank crews lift children onto their flower-garlanded tanks to play. Cheering Germans in garrison town welcome back tank regiment as it parades by. Hitler Youth boys wave white handkerchiefs and young members of the BDM throw flowers at the tanks passing by. CUs of Germans.
