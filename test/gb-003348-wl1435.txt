Berlin Medical Unions: various papers

4 folders; 1 bundle

Information regarding provenance is unknown. However, judging from the amount of correspondence addressed to Arthur Gliksman, former chairman of the Aerztlicher Standesverein der Koenigstadt zu Berlin, it is assumed that he was responsible for creating this collection.<br/><br/>The papers have been arranged according to organisation.

This collection consists of papers which document the activities of the Berlin medical unions, Berliner Aerztlichen Standesvereine, in general and that of the Aerztlicher Standesverein der Koenigstadt zu Berlin in particular. Note that it appears that the latter organisation ceased to exist on 31 March 1936 according to a note at the end of the last set of minutes (1435/1/3).
