The Kornspan family collection consists of documents, photographs, and correspondence from Leon and Mendel Kornspan and others from Poland and Palestine to Fannie Ebert and her husband Sam. Fannie and her brother Joseph (Yusha) immigrated to the United States before 1926 but Mendel and Leon did not, and they did not survive.
