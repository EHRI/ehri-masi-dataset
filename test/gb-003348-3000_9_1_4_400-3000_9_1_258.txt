Correspondence with Carlson, John Roy

38 letters

John Roy Carlson was the Alias of Arthur Derounian (born Avedis Boghos Derounian; 1909-1991), a US American journalist and author of Armenian origin. Using the pseudonym he published two bestselling books on Nazi sympathizers in the USA (1943) and the involvement of former Nazis in the Arab-Israeli conflict (1951).

The correspondence centres mainly on trips Derounian undertook to Germany to accomplish an undercover investigation on the political atmosphere and to expose postwar Nazi groups. Some of them had apparently being in contact with British fascist leader Oswald Mosely. Over the course of his investigation, Derounian supplied the Library with copies of several right wing publications. Other parts concern the exchange of other published material, including material to Armenia and Africa.
