Testimony, 42 pages, handwritten in Polish, with English translated summary. Krajewska, living in Belgium in 1993, saw an article about events that took place in her home town of Olobok in 1943, when a planned delivery of weapons to Polish partisans (Armia Krajowa) from the Polish government-in-exile in London was discovered and aborted by German SS, who took revenge on villagers. Includes English and Polish texts, news clippings and snapshots of present-day memorial.
