Isaac Frankel was a German Jew and survivor of the Holocaust. He was deported to German-occupied Poland with his family and was eventually imprisoned in Buchenwald. After liberation he traveled to Italy and lived in various Italian cities before immigrating to the United States in 1947.

Includes two testimonies (one original and one photocopy) written by Isaac Frankel. Both testimonies are attached to letters that summarize Mr. Frankel's life as a Holocaust survivor. The testimonies describe Frankel's experiences of deportation, the loss of his young family, his imprisonment in ghettos and forced labor camps, his survival of several selections, and his survival of Buchenwald. The second testimony is not a copy of the first but contains similar information.
