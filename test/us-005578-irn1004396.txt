Anton Mussert gives a speech

A gathering of Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB) members in the outdoor amphitheater in the Rotspark in Valkenburg. The stands are crowded with men and women. Anton Mussert, leader of the NSB, enters the amphitheater while the whole crowd salutes him. Flags are marched to the front of the amphitheater. Mussert walks to the podium to give a speech. IWM translation of the voiceover narration: Mussert stated that "Europe must remain the cultural centre of the world. We National Socialists do not hang our heads. To fight for fortunate Netherlands in a fortunate Europe remains our duty and mission. This battle is tough but will not be fought in vain." Shots of the crowd listening to Mussert's speech.
