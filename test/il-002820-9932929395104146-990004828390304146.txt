Letter from A. Melski, to Todtli,asking to be informed of date of trial, as he has a busy lecture schedule, and hopes he can be in Koln and Dusseldorf in February. He indicates that he is in possession of evidence that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were distributed to the White Army during the 1917 revolution and caused its dissolution. Additionally, he discusses the acceptance of a plan to meet before the trial to discuss a plan of economic attack against the Jews.
