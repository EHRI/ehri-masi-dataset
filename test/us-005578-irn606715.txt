Sidney Lindenheim (b. 1924) was born Siegfried (Sigi, Ziggy) Lindenheim in Vienna to Jacob (Chaim, b. 1885) and Eva (Chawe, b. 1885) Lindenheim, who had relocated to Austria from Poland (Łuków and Skierniewice). Sidney immigrated to the United States via Cherbourg in March 1939, and Jacob and Eva immigrated via Genoa in February 1940.

The Sidney Lindenheim papers consist of German passports for Sidney, Jacob, and Eva Lindenheim, an immigration registration receipt for Chaskel, Gitta, and Amos Lindenheim, and an address book, notebook, and photograph taken aboard the SS Queen Mary documenting Sidney Lindenheim’s immigration to the United States in 1939. The address book and notebook contain addresses of friends and relatives in Europe and America as well as minimal notes about Lindenheim’s immigration.
