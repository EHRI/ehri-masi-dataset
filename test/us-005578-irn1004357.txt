Six clips from an anti-Jewish Nazi propaganda film, Jud Süß

01:08:59 to 01:09:29 Opening credits: Eight candles burn in front of a Star of David, then the title of the film and the name of the director, Veit Harlan, appears, among other credits. A man's voice singing a Hebrew prayer accompanies the credits. 01:09:32 to 01:09:44 The coach carrying the newly coronated Duke of the Duchy of Wuerttemberg, Karl Alexander, drives through the festively decorated town of Stuttgart. The Duke waves to crowds of well-wishers. The year is 1733. 01:09:47 to 01:10:04 The Jewish district in Frankfurt, where Joseph Suess Oppenheimer lives. Two Jews, an old man and a young woman, look down from a window at another man. The dialogue is not complete but the man in the street refers to the fact that Suess will loan money to the Duke so that the Jews can "take, take, take." 01:10:07 to 01:10:28 Joseph Suess Oppenheimer, in beard and caftan, closes the door behind the Duke's adviser, who has been sent to ask him for jewels for the Duchess (the adviser does not appear in this clip). Good CU on Suess as he says that he will open the door for the Jews [who are banned from entering the city of Stuttgart]. Brief shot of Suess, now with no beard and wearing courtly clothing, riding in a coach on his way to Stuttgart. 01:10:31 to 01:10:45 Incomplete clip from the first confrontation between Suess and Faber, Dorothea's fiancé. Faber recognizes immediately that Suess is a Jew and belligerently advises him to leave the city immediately, because Jews are not allowed in Stuttgart. Suess lowers his eyes and congratulates Faber on his ability to recognize his ethnicity. The dialogue in this clip is cut off. 01:10:48 to 01:11:17 Suess pours coins from a purse onto a desk and says that he would consider himself fortunate to be considered a faithful servant of the Duke. The coins fade into the next scene, where several ballet dancers perform. [The Duke has been denied funding for a ballet by the members of his council, so Suess provides the money in order to strengthen his hold over the Duke].
