'Tran und Helle' dialogue re. foreign newspapers

Tran is reading a newspaper when there is a knock at the door. He quickly puts the paper away as Helle enters. Tran tells Helle that the German public is not aware of England's great victories in the war. Helle denies that this is true, and Tran produces the English newspaper to make his point. Helle dismisses the content of the newspaper and tears it into squares, saying that now it is the proper format . . . to be used in the WC. Tran and Helle were a comic duo who appeared in Nazi newsreels. In each episode Tran [dopey] made stupid mistakes which were corrected by Helle [brilliance].
