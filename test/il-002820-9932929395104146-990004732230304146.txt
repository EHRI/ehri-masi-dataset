[Propaganda gegen Deutschland un Gegenpropaganda]

1 electronic resource (4 pages)

Summary of the German Embassy in the United States to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin regarding a questionaire about Anti-German Propaganda, dated 17.08.1933. There is hardly any Anti-German Propaganda in the United States any more. Also there is hardly any French and Polish influence regarding Anti-German Propaganda. Other countries do not have any influence. Apart from singular travel reports and refugee stories, there is no influence from Germany, neither. The best preventive measure against Anti-German Propaganda seems to be informing the American public about objectives and policies of the German government. There is still a lively demand for English language material, which could not be satisfied yet.
