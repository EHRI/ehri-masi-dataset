Abraham (Abe) Morgenstern was born in 1923 in Lublin, Poland. His parents were Russian Jews who moved to Lublin in 1921. Abe attended both a Polish public school and a Jewish school. He graduated from a business school at the age of 16 in 1939. In April 1942, the Morgenstern family was forced to move into one of Lublin’s two ghettos. Abe’s father and sister perished during one of the first actions. Abe and his mother survived and were eventually liberated by the Russians. After the war, they immigrated to Italy, and later to the United States.

The collection consists of photographs of Abraham Morgenstern (Abe), originally of Czortków, Poland (Chortkiv, Ukraine), and his friend Jack Honig in displaced persons camps in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, and Bari, Italy after the Holocaust.
