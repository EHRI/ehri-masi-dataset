1 folder

This copy translation of a document, the original of which was issued by the High Command of the <i>Wehrmacht</i>, was given to the depositor by Major Christopher Milner. The whereabouts of the original is unknown. Nor is it known how Major Milner came into possession of it. A letter dated January 1985 from the Imperial War Museum to Major Milner casts doubt on its authenticity.
