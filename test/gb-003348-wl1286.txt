â€˜The St. Louis Affair': list of passengers who found refuge in Great Britain

1 folder

The German steamship, the St. Louis, left Hamburg with 930 Jewish refugees on board on 13 May 1939. Its passengers had valid immigration visas to Cuba stamped in their passports. When the ship arrived at Havana, the refugees were refused entry. The ship was turned back to Europe, where its passengers, after much negotiation were permitted to land in English and Western European ports. Those caught up by the Nazi invasion ultimately met their deaths a year later in the Holocaust.

This copy list of passengers on the infamous ship, the St. Louis, was probably generated from a database at the Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington.
