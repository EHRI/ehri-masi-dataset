Vichy recruits for German Army

Good HA establishing shot of Place des Invalides in Paris as (Secretary of State of Vichy government) Joseph Darnand administers oath of allegiance to French recruits of the German Army. Quick shot of Darnand. Recruits in uniforms and berets kneel on pavement. VS onlookers in courtyard and pairs of women looking down from above. CU tricolor banner that says "Francaise" and has an unidentified symbol at center. CU men kneeling; they salute. LS men at attention in courtyard. Shot of banner again. LS March out through iron-grill gate to Arc de Triomphe. Several shots of tomb of France's unknown soldier, including good final HA, with several people giving Nazi salute. Narration tells that this is the first time Darnand, "the French prototype of Himmler," appeared in a German newsreel.
