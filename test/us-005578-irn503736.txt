Steinbach family letters

1

Rudi Steinbach was a German Jew who emigrated from Germany to Palestine in 1939. He later immigrated to the United States.

Consists of letters, written from March 1939 to September 1943, exchanged, for the most part, between Walter and Hans Steinbach. The letters contain information about the attempts of Walter and Hans Steinbach to rescue their father, Gustav Israel Steinbach, from Bełżyce (apparently a reference to the ghetto of that name) near Lublin, Poland.
