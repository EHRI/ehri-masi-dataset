Prefettura di Mantova. Carteggio (1866-1951)

2970 folders

In this subfonds, only two folders (n° 2890 and 2891) are related to the Holocaust period, but they are extremely important and actually they should be kept in another fonds of the Mantua State Archive, that is EGELI (see it), as they hold documents of the “dissequestro” (un-seizure) of the Jewish belongings after World War II. In these two folders there is a list, kept in alphabetical order, of all the seizure of Jewish belongings for which no decree of un-seizure had intervened (that is, Jewish family who had not yet received their properties back); every family name’s file contains the sequestration decree and all the belongings seized, real estate or personal property; in the second folder, reports of restitutions follow, also kept in alphabetical order.
