United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

The Renate Bob collection consists of a report regarding the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp written immediately after the war, likely by a former inmate of the camp. The report (which was called "Mia's Report" by the donor's mother, though the author remains unknown) describes the history of the camp and the lives of prisoners. It was written in German but the collection also includes an English language translation. Also includes a document from the Dutch Red Cross to Hilde Hochfeld (Hoke) letting her know that members of the Katz family of Amsterdam perished in Sobibor in May and June 1943.
